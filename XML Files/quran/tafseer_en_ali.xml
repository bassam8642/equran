	<SOURA id="2" name="The Cow">
		<AYA id="002001">Alif. Lm. Mm.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002002">This is the Book; in it is guidance sure, without doubt, to those who fear Allah;</AYA>
		<AYA id="002003">Who believe in the Unseen, are steadfast in prayer, and spend out of what We have provided for them;</AYA>
		<AYA id="002004">And who believe in the Revelation sent to thee, and sent before thy time, and (in their hearts) have the assurance of the Hereafter.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002005">They are on (true) guidance, from their Lord, and it is these who will prosper.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002006">As to those who reject Faith, it is the same to them whether thou warn them or do not warn them; they will not believe.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002007">Allah hath set a seal on their hearts and on their hearing. And on their eyes is a veil; great is the penalty they (incur).</AYA>
		<AYA id="002008">Of the people there are some who say: "We believe in Allah and the Last Day;" but they do not (really) believe.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002009">Fain would they deceive Allah and those who believe, but they only deceive themselves, and realize (it) not!</AYA>
		<AYA id="002010">In their hearts is a disease; and Allah has increased their disease: And grievous is the penalty they (incur), because they are false (to themselves).</AYA>
		<AYA id="002011">When it is said to them: "Make not mischief on the earth," they say: "Why, we only want to make peace!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="002012">Of a surety, they are the ones who make mischief, but they realize (it) not.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002013">When it is said to them: "Believe as the others believe:" They say: "Shall we believe as the fools believe?" Nay, of a surety they are the fools, but they do not know.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002014">When they meet those who believe, they say: "We believe;" but when they are alone with their evil ones, they say: "We are really with you: We (were) only jesting."</AYA>
		<AYA id="002015">Allah will throw back their mockery on them, and give them rope in their trespasses; so they will wander like blind ones (to and fro).</AYA>
		<AYA id="002016">These are they who have bartered Guidance for error: But their traffic is profitless, and they have lost true direction,</AYA>
		<AYA id="002017">Their similitude is that of a man who kindled a fire; when it lighted all around him, Allah took away their light and left them in utter darkness. So they could not see.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002018">Deaf, dumb, and blind, they will not return (to the path).</AYA>
		<AYA id="002019">Or (another similitude) is that of a rain-laden cloud from the sky: In it are zones of darkness, and thunder and lightning: They press their fingers in their ears to keep out the stunning thunder-clap, the while they are in terror of death. But Allah is ever round the rejecters of Faith!</AYA>
		<AYA id="002020">The lightning all but snatches away their sight; every time the light (Helps) them, they walk therein, and when the darkness grows on them, they stand still. And if Allah willed, He could take away their faculty of hearing and seeing; for Allah hath power over all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002021">O ye people! Worship your Guardian Lord, who created you and those who came before you, that ye may become righteous;</AYA>
		<AYA id="002022">Who has made the earth your couch, and the heavens your canopy; and sent down rain from the heavens; and brought forth therewith Fruits for your sustenance; then set not up rivals unto Allah when ye know (the truth).</AYA>
		<AYA id="002023">And if ye are in doubt as to what We have revealed from time to time to Our servant, then produce a Srah like thereunto; and call your witnesses or helpers (if there are any) besides Allah, if your (doubts) are true.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002024">But if ye cannot - and of a surety ye cannot - then fear the Fire whose fuel is men and stones,- which is prepared for those who reject Faith.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002025">But give glad tidings to those who believe and work righteousness, that their portion is Gardens, beneath which rivers flow. Every time they are fed with fruits therefrom, they say: "Why, this is what we were fed with before," for they are given things in similitude; and they have therein spouses purified; and they abide therein (for ever).</AYA>
		<AYA id="002026">Allah disdains not to use the similitude of things, even of a gnat as well as anything above it. Those who believe know that it is truth from their Lord; but those who reject Faith say: "What means Allah by this similitude?" By it He causes many to stray, and many He leads into the right path; but He causes not to stray, except those who forsake (the path),-</AYA>
		<AYA id="002027">Those who break Allah's Covenant after it is ratified, and who sunder what Allah Has ordered to be joined, and do mischief on earth: These cause loss (only) to themselves.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002028">How can ye reject the faith in Allah?- seeing that ye were without life, and He gave you life; then will He cause you to die, and will again bring you to life; and again to Him will ye return.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002029">It is He Who hath created for you all things that are on earth; Then He turned to the heavens, and made them into seven firmaments; and of all things He hath perfect knowledge.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002030">Behold, thy Lord said to the angels: "I will create a vicegerent on earth." They said: "Wilt Thou place therein one who will make mischief therein and shed blood?- whilst we do celebrate Thy praises and glorify Thy holy (name)?" He said: "I know what ye know not."</AYA>
		<AYA id="002031">And He taught Adam the names of all things; then He placed them before the angels, and said: "Tell me the names of these if ye are right."</AYA>
		<AYA id="002032">They said: "Glory to Thee, of knowledge We have none, save what Thou Hast taught us: In truth it is Thou Who art perfect in knowledge and wisdom."</AYA>
		<AYA id="002033">He said: "O Adam! Tell them their natures." When he had told them, Allah said: "Did I not tell you that I know the secrets of heaven and earth, and I know what ye reveal and what ye conceal?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="002034">And behold, We said to the angels: "Bow down to Adam" and they bowed down. Not so Iblis: he refused and was haughty: he was of those who reject Faith.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002035">And We said: "O Adam! dwell thou and thy wife in the Garden; and eat of the bountiful things therein as (where and when) ye will; but approach not this tree, or ye run into harm and transgression."</AYA>
		<AYA id="002036">Then did Satan make them slip from the (Garden), and get them out of the state (of felicity) in which they had been. And We said: "Get ye down, all (ye people), with enmity between yourselves. On earth will be your dwelling place and your means of livelihood - for a time."</AYA>
		<AYA id="002037">Then learnt Adam from his Lord certain words, and (Allah) accepted his repentance; for He is Oft-Returning, Most Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002038">We said: "Get ye down all from here; and if, as is sure, there comes to you Guidance from Me, whosoever follows My guidance, on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002039">"But those who reject Faith and belie Our Signs, they shall be companions of the Fire; they shall abide therein."</AYA>
		<AYA id="002040">O Children of Israel! call to mind the (special) favor which I bestowed upon you, and fulfill your covenant with Me as I shall fulfill My covenant with you, and fear none but Me.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002041">And believe in what I reveal, confirming the revelation which is with you, and be not the first to reject Faith therein, nor sell My Signs for a small price; and fear Me, and Me alone.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002042">And cover not Truth with falsehood, nor conceal the Truth when ye know (what it is).</AYA>
		<AYA id="002043">And be steadfast in prayer; give Zakat; and bow down your heads with those who bow down (in worship).</AYA>
		<AYA id="002044">Do ye enjoin right conduct on the people, and forget (to practice it) yourselves, and yet ye study the Scripture? Will ye not understand?</AYA>
		<AYA id="002045">Nay, seek (Allah's) help with patient perseverance and prayer: It is indeed hard, except to those who are humble,-</AYA>
		<AYA id="002046">Who bear in mind the certainty that they are to meet their Lord, and that they are to return to Him.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002047">O Children of Israel! call to mind the (special) favor which I bestowed upon you, and that I preferred you to all others (for My Message).</AYA>
		<AYA id="002048">Then guard yourselves against a day when one soul shall not avail another nor shall intercession be accepted for her, nor shall compensation be taken from her, nor shall anyone be helped (from outside).</AYA>
		<AYA id="002049">And remember, We delivered you from the people of Pharaoh: They set you hard tasks and punishments, slaughtered your sons and let your women-folk live; therein was a tremendous trial from your Lord.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002050">And remember We divided the sea for you and saved you and drowned Pharaoh's people within your very sight.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002051">And remember We appointed forty nights for Moses, and in his absence ye took the calf (for worship), and ye did grievous wrong.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002052">Even then We did forgive you; there was a chance for you to be grateful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002053">And remember We gave Moses the Scripture and the Criterion (Between right and wrong): There was a chance for you to be guided aright.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002054">And remember Moses said to his people: "O my people! Ye have indeed wronged yourselves by your worship of the calf: So turn (in repentance) to your Maker, and slay yourselves (the wrong-doers); that will be better for you in the sight of your Maker." Then He turned towards you (in forgiveness): For He is Oft- Returning, Most Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002055">And remember ye said: "O Moses! We shall never believe in thee until we see Allah manifestly," Thereupon ye were dazed with thunderbolt even as ye looked on.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002056">Then We raised you up after your death; ye had the chance to be grateful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002057">And We gave you the shade of clouds and sent down to you Manna and quails, saying: "Eat of the good things We have provided for you:" (But they rebelled); to Us they did no harm, but they harmed their own souls.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002058">And remember We said: "Enter this town, and eat of the plenty therein as ye wish; and enter the gate prostrating (with humility), and say: "Forgive (us)"; We shall forgive you your faults and increase (the portion of) those who do good."</AYA>
		<AYA id="002059">But the transgressors changed the word from that which had been given them; so We sent on the transgressors a plague from heaven, for that they infringed (Our command) repeatedly.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002060">And remember Moses prayed for water for his people; We said: "Strike the rock with thy staff." Then gushed forth therefrom twelve springs. Each group knew its own place for water. So eat and drink of the sustenance provided by Allah, and do no evil nor mischief on the (face of the) earth.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002061">And remember ye said: "O Moses! we cannot endure one kind of food (always); so beseech thy Lord for us to produce for us of what the earth groweth, -its pot-herbs, and cucumbers, Its garlic, lentils, and onions." He said: "Will ye exchange the better for the worse? Go ye down to any town, and ye shall find what ye want!" They were covered with humiliation and misery; they drew on themselves the wrath of Allah. This because they went on rejecting the Signs of Allah and slaying His Messengers without just cause. This because they rebelled and went on transgressing.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002062">Those who believe (in the Quran), and those who follow the Jewish (scriptures), and the Christians and the Sabians,- any who believe in Allah and the Last Day, and work righteousness, shall have their reward with their Lord; on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002063">And remember We took your covenant and We raised above you the Mount (Sinai) : (Saying): "Hold firmly to what We have given you and bring (ever) to remembrance what is therein: Perchance ye may fear Allah."</AYA>
		<AYA id="002064">But ye turned back thereafter: Had it not been for the Grace and Mercy of Allah to you, ye had surely been among the lost.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002065">And well ye knew those amongst you who transgressed in the matter of the Sabbath: We said to them: "Be ye apes, despised and rejected."</AYA>
		<AYA id="002066">So We made it an example to their own time and to their posterity, and a lesson to those who fear Allah.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002067">And remember Moses said to his people: "Allah commands that ye sacrifice a heifer." They said: "Makest thou a laughing-stock of us?" He said: "Allah save me from being an ignorant (fool)!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="002068">They said: "Beseech on our behalf Thy Lord to make plain to us what (heifer) it is!" He said; "He says: The heifer should be neither too old nor too young, but of middling age. Now do what ye are commanded!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="002069">They said: "Beseech on our behalf Thy Lord to make plain to us her color." He said: "He says: A fawn-colored heifer, pure and rich in tone, the admiration of beholders!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="002070">They said: "Beseech on our behalf Thy Lord to make plain to us what she is: To us are all heifers alike: We wish indeed for guidance, if Allah wills."</AYA>
		<AYA id="002071">He said: "He says: A heifer not trained to till the soil or water the fields; sound and without blemish." They said: "Now hast thou brought the truth." Then they offered her in sacrifice, and they scarcely did it.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002072">Remember ye slew a man and fell into a dispute among yourselves as to the crime: But Allah was to bring forth what ye did hide.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002073">So We said: "Strike the (body) with a piece of the (heifer)." Thus Allah bringeth the dead to life and showeth you His Signs: Perchance ye may understand.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002074">Thenceforth were your hearts hardened: They became like a rock and even worse in hardness. For among rocks there are some from which rivers gush forth; others there are which when split asunder send forth water; and others which sink for fear of Allah. And Allah is not unmindful of what ye do.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002075">Can ye (O ye men of Faith) entertain the hope that they will believe in you?- Seeing that a party of them heard the Word of Allah, and perverted it knowingly after they understood it.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002076">Behold! when they meet the men of Faith, they say: "We believe": But when they meet each other in private, they say: "Shall you tell them what Allah hath revealed to you, that they may engage you in argument about it before your Lord?"- Do ye not understand (their aim)?</AYA>
		<AYA id="002077">Know they not that Allah knoweth what they conceal and what they reveal?</AYA>
		<AYA id="002078">And there are among them illiterates, who know not the Book, but (see therein their own) desires, and they do nothing but conjecture.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002079">Then woe to those who write the Book with their own hands, and then say: "This is from Allah," to traffic with it for miserable price!- Woe to them for what their hands do write, and for the gain they make thereby.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002080">And they say: "The Fire shall not touch us but for a few numbered days:" Say: "Have ye taken a promise from Allah, for He never breaks His promise? or is it that ye say of Allah what ye do not know?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="002081">Nay, those who seek gain in evil, and are girt round by their sins,- they are companions of the Fire: Therein shall they abide (for ever).</AYA>
		<AYA id="002082">But those who have faith and work righteousness, they are companions of the Garden: Therein shall they abide (For ever).</AYA>
		<AYA id="002083">And remember We took a covenant from the Children of Israel (to this effect): Worship none but Allah. treat with kindness your parents and kindred, and orphans and those in need; speak fair to the people; be steadfast in prayer; and give Zakat. Then did ye turn back, except a few among you, and ye backslide (even now).</AYA>
		<AYA id="002084">And remember We took your covenant (to this effect): Shed no blood amongst you, nor turn out your own people from your homes: and this ye solemnly ratified, and to this ye were witness.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002085">After this it is ye, the same people, who slay among yourselves, and banish a party of you from their homes; assist (their enemies) against them, in guilt and transgression; and if they come to you as captives, ye ransom them, though it was not lawful for you to banish them. Then is it only a part of the Book that ye believe in, and do ye reject the rest? but what is the reward for those among you who behave like this but disgrace in this life?- and on the Day of Judgment they shall be consigned to the most grievous penalty. For Allah is not unmindful of what ye do.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002086">These are the people who buy the life of this world at the price of the Hereafter: their penalty shall not be lightened nor shall they be helped.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002087">We gave Moses the Book and followed him up with a succession of messengers; We gave Jesus the son of Mary Clear (Signs) and strengthened him with the Holy Spirit. Is it that whenever there comes to you a messenger with what ye yourselves desire not, ye are puffed up with pride?- Some ye called impostors, and others ye slay!</AYA>
		<AYA id="002088">They say, "Our hearts are the wrappings (which preserve Allah's Word: we need no more)." Nay, Allah's curse is on them for their blasphemy: Little is it they believe.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002089">And when there comes to them a Book from Allah, confirming what is with them,- although from of old they had prayed for victory against those without Faith,- when there comes to them that which they (should) have recognized, they refuse to believe in it, but the curse of Allah is on those without Faith.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002090">Miserable is the price for which they have sold their souls, in that they deny (the revelation) which Allah has sent down, in insolent envy that Allah of His Grace should send it to any of His servants He pleases: Thus have they drawn on themselves Wrath upon Wrath. And humiliating is the chastisement of those who reject Faith.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002091">When it is said to them, "Believe in what Allah Hath sent down, "they say, "We believe in what was sent down to us:" yet they reject all besides, even if it be Truth confirming what is with them. Say: "Why then have ye slain the prophets of Allah in times gone by, if ye did indeed believe?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="002092">There came to you Moses with clear (Signs); yet ye worshipped the calf (even) after that, and ye did behave wrongfully.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002093">And remember We took your covenant and We raised above you them Mount (Sinai): (Saying): "Hold firmly to what We have given you, and hearken (to the Law)": They said:" We hear, and we disobey:" And their hearts were filled (with the love) of the calf because of their Faithlessness. Say: "Vile indeed are the behests of your Faith if ye have any faith!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="002094">Say: "If the last Home, with Allah, be for you specially, and not for anyone else, then seek ye for death, if ye are sincere."</AYA>
		<AYA id="002095">But they will never seek for death, on account of the (sins) which their hands have sent on before them. And Allah is well-acquainted with the wrong-doers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002096">Thou wilt indeed find them, of all people, most greedy of life,-even more than the idolaters: Each one of them wishes he could be given a life of a thousand years: But the grant of such life will not save him from (due) punishment. For Allah sees well all that they do.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002097">Say: Whoever is an enemy to Gabriel - for he brings down the (revelation) to thy heart by Allah's will, a confirmation of what went before, and guidance and glad tidings for those who believe,-</AYA>
		<AYA id="002098">Whoever is an enemy to Allah and His angels and messengers, to Gabriel and Michael,- Lo! Allah is an enemy to those who reject Faith.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002099">We have sent down to thee Manifest Signs (ayat); and none reject them but those who are perverse.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002100">Is it not (the case) that every time they make a covenant, some party among them throw it aside?- Nay, Most of them are faithless.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002101">And when there came to them a messenger from Allah, confirming what was with them, a party of the People of the Book threw away the Book of Allah behind their backs, as if (it had been something) they did not know!</AYA>
		<AYA id="002102">They followed what the Satans recited (falsely) over Solomon's kingdom. Solomon did not disbelieve, but the Satans disbelieved, teaching men magic, and such things as came down at Babylon to the angels Harut and Marut. But neither of these taught anyone (Such things) without saying: "We are only for trial; so do not blaspheme." They learned from them the means to sow discord between man and wife. But they could not thus harm anyone except by Allah's permission. And they learned what harmed them, not what profited them. And they knew that the buyers of (magic) would have no share in the happiness of the Hereafter. And vile was the price for which they did sell their souls, if they but knew!</AYA>
		<AYA id="002103">If they had kept their Faith and guarded themselves from evil, far better had been the reward from Allah, if they but knew!</AYA>
		<AYA id="002104">O ye of Faith! Say not (to the Messenger) Rn, but say unthurna (i.e. say not words of ambiguous import, but words of respect); and hearken (to him): To those without Faith is a grievous punishment.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002105">It is never the wish of those without Faith among the People of the Book, nor of the polytheists, that anything good should come down to you from your Lord. But Allah will choose for His special Mercy whom He will - for Allah is Lord of grace abounding.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002106">None of Our revelations do We abrogate or cause to be forgotten, but We substitute something better or similar: Knowest thou not that Allah Hath power over all things?</AYA>
		<AYA id="002107">Knowest thou not that to Allah belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth? And besides Him ye have neither patron nor helper.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002108">Would ye question your Messenger as Moses was questioned of old? but whoever changeth from Faith to Unbelief, Hath strayed without doubt from the even way.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002109">Quite a number of the People of the Book wish they could turn you (people) back to infidelity after ye have believed, from selfish envy, after the truth hath become manifest unto them: But forgive and overlook, till Allah brings about his command; for Allah Hath power over all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002110">And be steadfast in prayer and regular in charity: And whatever good ye send forth for your souls before you, ye shall find it with Allah. for Allah sees Well all that ye do.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002111">And they say: "None shall enter Paradise unless he be a Jew or a Christian." Those are their (vain) desires. Say: "Produce your proof if ye are truthful."</AYA>
		<AYA id="002112">Nay,-whoever submits His whole self to Allah and is a doer of good,- He will get his reward with his Lord; on such shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002113">The Jews say: "The Christians have naught (to stand) upon; and the Christians say: "The Jews have naught (to stand) upon." Yet they (profess to) study the (same) Book. Like unto their word is what those say who know not; but Allah will judge between them in their quarrel on the Day of Judgment.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002114">And who is more unjust than he who forbids that in places for the worship of Allah, His name should be celebrated?-whose zeal is (in fact) to ruin them? It was not fitting that such should themselves enter them except in fear. For them there is nothing but disgrace in this world, and in the world to come, an exceeding torment.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002115">To Allah belong the East and the West: whithersoever ye turn, there is Allah's face. For Allah is All-Embracing, All-Knowing.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002116">They say: "(Allah) hath begotten a son" :Glory be to Him.-Nay, to Him belongs all that is in the heavens and on earth: everything renders worship to Him.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002117">The Originator of the heavens and the earth: When He decreeth a matter, He saith to it: "Be," and it is.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002118">Say those without knowledge: "Why speaketh not Allah unto us? or why cometh not unto us a Sign?" So said the people before them words of similar import. Their hearts are alike. We have indeed made clear the Signs unto any people who hold firmly to Faith (in their hearts).</AYA>
		<AYA id="002119">Verily, We have sent thee in truth as a bearer of glad tidings and a warner: But of thee no question shall be asked of the companions of the Blazing Fire.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002120">Never will the Jews or the Christians be satisfied with thee unless thou follow their form of religion. Say: "The Guidance of Allah,-that is the (only) Guidance." Wert thou to follow their desires after the knowledge which hath reached thee, then wouldst thou find neither protector nor helper against Allah.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002121">Those to whom We have given the Book study it as it should be studied: They are the ones that believe therein: Those who reject faith therein,- the loss is their own.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002122">O Children of Israel! call to mind the special favor which I bestowed upon you, and that I preferred you to all others.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002123">Then guard yourselves against a Day when one soul shall not avail another, nor shall compensation be accepted from her nor shall intercession profit her nor shall anyone be helped (from outside).</AYA>
		<AYA id="002124">And remember that Abraham was tried by his Lord with certain commands, which he fulfilled: He said: "I will make thee an Imam to the Nations." He pleaded: "And also (Imams) from my offspring!" He answered: "But My Promise is not within the reach of evil-doers."</AYA>
		<AYA id="002125">Remember We made the House a place of assembly for men and a place of safety; and take ye the Station of Abraham as a place of prayer; and We covenanted with Abraham and Ismail, that they should sanctify My House for those who compass it round, or use it as a retreat, or bow, or prostrate themselves (therein in prayer).</AYA>
		<AYA id="002126">And remember Abraham said: "My Lord, make this a City of Peace, and feed its people with fruits,-such of them as believe in Allah and the Last Day." He said: "(Yea), and such as reject Faith,-for a while will I grant them their pleasure, but will soon drive them to the torment of Fire,- an evil destination (indeed)!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="002127">And remember Abraham and Ismail raised the foundations of the House (with this prayer): "Our Lord! Accept (this service) from us: For Thou art the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing."</AYA>
		<AYA id="002128">"Our Lord! make of us Muslims, bowing to Thy (Will), and of our progeny a people Muslim, bowing to Thy (Will); and show us our place for the celebration of (due) rites; and turn unto us (in Mercy); for Thou art the Oft-Relenting, Most Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002129">"Our Lord! send amongst them a Messenger of their own, who shall rehearse Thy Signs to them and instruct them in scripture and wisdom, and sanctify them: For Thou art the Exalted in Might, the Wise."</AYA>
		<AYA id="002130">And who turns away from the religion of Abraham but such as debase their souls with folly? Him We chose and rendered pure in this world: And he will be in the Hereafter in the ranks of the Righteous.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002131">Behold! his Lord said to him: "Submit (thy will to Me):" He said: "I submit (my will) to the Lord and Cherisher of the Universe."</AYA>
		<AYA id="002132">And this was the legacy that Abraham left to his sons, and so did Jacob; "Oh my sons! Allah hath chosen the Faith for you; then die not except in the state of submission."</AYA>
		<AYA id="002133">Were ye witnesses when death appeared before Jacob? Behold, he said to his sons: "What will ye worship after me?" They said: "We shall worship Thy God and the God of thy fathers, of Abraham, Ismail and Isaac,- the One (True) God. To Him do we submit (in Islm)."</AYA>
		<AYA id="002134">That was a people that hath passed away. They shall reap the fruit of what they did, and ye of what ye do! Ye shall not be asked about what they did.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002135">They say: "Become Jews or Christians if ye would be guided (to salvation)." Say thou: "Nay! (I would rather) the Religion of Abraham the True, and he joined not gods with Allah."</AYA>

		<AYA id="002141">That was a people that hath passed away. They shall reap the fruit of what they did, and ye of what ye do! Of their merits there is no question in your case:</AYA>
		<AYA id="002142">The fools among the people will say: "What hath turned them from the Qibla to which they were used?" Say: To Allah belong both East and West: He guideth whom He will to a way that is straight.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002143">Thus, have We made of you an Ummah justly balanced, that ye might be witnesses over the nations, and the Messenger a witness over yourselves; and We appointed the Qibla to which thou wast used, only to test those who followed the Messenger from those who would turn on their heels (from the Faith). Indeed it was (a change) momentous, except to those guided by Allah. And never would Allah Make your faith of no effect. For Allah is to all people Most surely full of kindness, Most Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002144">We see the turning of thy face (for guidance) to the heavens: now Shall We turn thee to a Qibla that shall please thee. Turn then thy face in the direction of the Sacred Mosque: Wherever ye are, turn your faces in that direction. The People of the Book know well that that is the truth from their Lord. Nor is Allah unmindful of what they do.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002145">Even if thou wert to bring to the People of the Book all the Signs (together), they would not follow thy Qibla; nor art thou going to follow their Qibla; nor indeed will they follow each other's Qibla. If thou after the knowledge hath reached thee, Wert to follow their (vain) desires,- then wert thou Indeed (clearly) in the wrong.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002146">The People of the Book know this as they know their own sons; but some of them conceal the truth which they themselves know.</AYA>

		<AYA id="002151">A similar (favor have ye already received) in that We have sent among you a Messenger of your own, rehearsing to you Our Signs, and sanctifying you, and instructing you in Scripture and Wisdom, and in new knowledge.</AYA>

		<AYA id="002159">Those who conceal the clear (Signs) We have sent down, and the Guidance, after We have made it clear for the People in the Book,-on them shall be Allah's curse, and the curse of those entitled to curse,-</AYA>

		<AYA id="002165">Yet there are men who take (for worship) others besides Allah, as equal (with Allah): They love them as they should love Allah. But those of Faith are overflowing in their love for Allah. If only the unrighteous could see, behold, they would see the penalty: that to Allah belongs all power, and Allah will strongly enforce the punishment.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002166">Then would those who are followed clear themselves of those who follow (them) : They would see the Chastisement, and all relations between them would be cut off.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002167">And those who followed would say: "If only we had one more chance, we would clear ourselves of them, as they have cleared themselves of us." Thus will Allah show them (the fruits of) their deeds as (nothing but) regrets. Nor will there be a way for them out of the Fire.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002168">O ye people! Eat of what is on earth, lawful and good; and do not follow the footsteps of the Satan, for he is to you an avowed enemy.</AYA>

		<AYA id="002170">When it is said to them: "Follow what Allah hath revealed:" They say: "Nay! we shall follow the ways of our fathers." What! even though their fathers were void of wisdom and guidance?</AYA>
		<AYA id="002171">The parable of those who reject Faith is as if one were to shout like a goat- herd, to things that listen to nothing but calls and cries: Deaf, dumb, and blind, they are void of wisdom.</AYA>

But if one is forced by necessity, without willful disobedience, nor transgressing due limits,- then is he guiltless. For Allah is Oft-Forgiving Most Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002174">Those who conceal Allah's revelations in the Book, and purchase for them a miserable profit,- they swallow into themselves naught but Fire; Allah will not address them on the Day of Resurrection, nor purify them: Grievous will be their penalty.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002175">They are the ones who buy Error in place of Guidance and Torment in place of Forgiveness. Ah! what boldness (they show) for the Fire!</AYA>
		<AYA id="002176">(Their doom is) because Allah sent down the Book in truth but those who seek causes of dispute in the Book are in a schism Far (from the purpose).</AYA>
		<AYA id="002177">It is not righteousness that ye turn your faces towards East or West; but it is righteousness- to believe in Allah and the Last Day, and the Angels, and the Book, and the Messengers; to spend of your substance, out of love for Him, for your kin, for orphans, for the needy, for the wayfarer, for those who ask, and for the ransom of slaves; to be steadfast in prayer, and give Zakat (regular charity); to fulfill the contracts which ye have made; and to be firm and patient, in pain (or suffering) and adversity, and throughout all periods of panic. Such are the people of truth, the God fearing.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002178">O ye who believe! the law of equality is prescribed to you in cases of murder: the free for the free, the slave for the slave, the woman for the woman. But if any remission is made by the brother of the slain, then grant any reasonable demand, and compensate him with handsome gratitude, this is a concession and a Mercy from your Lord. After this whoever exceeds the limits shall be in grave chastisement.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002179">In the Law of Equality there is (saving of) Life to you, O ye men of understanding; that ye may restrain yourselves.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002180">It is prescribed, when death approaches any of you, if he leave any goods that he make a bequest to parents and next of kin, according to reasonable usage; this is due from the God- fearing.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002181">If anyone changes the bequest after hearing it, the guilt shall be on those who make the change. For Allah hears and knows (All things).</AYA>
		<AYA id="002182">But if anyone fears partiality or wrong-doing on the part of the testator, and brings about a settlement amongst (the parties concerned), there is no wrong in him: For Allah is Oft- Forgiving, Most Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002183">O ye who believe! Fasting is prescribed to you as it was prescribed to those before you, that ye may (learn) self-restraint,-</AYA>
		<AYA id="002184">(Fasting) for a fixed number of days; but if any of you is ill, or on a journey, the prescribed number (should be made up) from days later. For those who can do it (with hardship), is a ransom, the feeding of one that is indigent. But he that will give more, of his own free will,- it is better for him. And it is better for you that ye fast, if ye only knew.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002185">Ramadhan is the (month) in which was sent down the Quran, as a guide to mankind, also clear (Signs) for guidance and judgment (between right and wrong). So every one of you who is present (at his home) during that month should spend it in fasting, but if any one is ill, or on a journey, the prescribed period (should be made up) by days later. Allah intends every facility for you; He does not want to put to difficulties. (He wants you) to complete the prescribed period, and to glorify Him in that He has guided you; and perchance ye shall be grateful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002186">When My servants ask thee concerning Me, I am indeed close (to them): I respond to the prayer of every suppliant when he calleth on Me: Let them also, with a will, Listen to My call, and believe in Me: That they may walk in the right way.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002187">Permitted to you, on the night of the fasts, is the approach to your wives. They are your garments and ye are their garments. Allah knoweth what ye used to do secretly among yourselves; but He turned to you and forgave you; so now associate with them, and seek what Allah Hath ordained for you, and eat and drink, until the white thread of dawn appear to you distinct from its black thread; then complete your fast till the night appears; but do not associate with your wives while ye are in retreat in the mosques. Those are limits (set by) Allah. Approach not nigh thereto. Thus doth Allah make clear His Signs to men: that they may learn self-restraint.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002188">And do not eat up your property among yourselves for vanities, nor use it as bait for the judges, with intent that ye may eat up wrongfully and knowingly a little of (other) people's property.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002189">They ask thee concerning the New Moons. Say: They are but signs to mark fixed periods of time in (the affairs of) men, and for Pilgrimage. It is no virtue if ye enter your houses from the back: It is virtue if ye fear Allah. Enter houses through the proper doors: And fear Allah. That ye may prosper.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002190">Fight in the cause of Allah those who fight you, but do not transgress limits; for Allah loveth not transgressors.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002191">And slay them wherever ye catch them, and turn them out from where they have turned you out; for persecution and oppression are worse than slaughter; but fight them not at the Sacred Mosque, unless they (first) fight you there; but if they fight you, slay them. Such is the reward of those who suppress faith.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002192">But if they cease, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002193">And fight them on until there is no more persecution or oppression, and the religion becomes Allah's. But if they cease. Let there be no hostility except to those who practice oppression.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002194">The prohibited month for the prohibited month,- and so for all things prohibited,- there is the law of equality. If then any one transgresses the prohibition against you, transgress ye likewise against him. But fear Allah, and know that Allah is with those who restrain themselves.</AYA>

		<AYA id="002196">And complete the Hajj or Umrah in the service of Allah. But if ye are prevented (from completing it), send an offering for sacrifice, such as ye may find, and do not shave your heads until the offering reaches the place of sacrifice. And if any of you is ill, or has an ailment in his scalp, (necessitating shaving), (he should) in compensation either fast, or feed the poor, or offer sacrifice; and when ye are in peaceful conditions (again), if any one wishes to continue the Umrah on to the Hajj, He must make an offering, such as he can afford, but if he cannot afford it, He should fast three days during the Hajj and seven days on his return, Making ten days in all. This is for those whose household is not in (the precincts of) the Sacred Mosque. And fear Allah, and know that Allah is strict in punishment.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002197">For Hajj are the months well known. If any one undertakes that duty therein, let there be no obscenity, nor wickedness, nor wrangling in the Hajj. And whatever good ye do, (be sure) Allah knoweth it. And take a provision (with you) for the journey, but the best of provisions is right conduct. So fear Me, O ye that are wise.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002198">It is no crime in you if ye seek of the bounty of your Lord (during pilgrimage). Then when ye pour down from (Mount) Arafat, celebrate the praises of Allah at the Sacred Monument, and celebrate His praises as He has directed you, even though, before this, ye went astray.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002199">Then return from the place whence it is usual for the multitude so to do, and ask for Allah's forgiveness. For Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002200">So when ye have accomplished your holy rites, celebrate the praises of Allah, as ye used to celebrate the praises of your fathers,- yea, with far more heart and soul. There are men who say: "Our Lord! Give us (Thy bounties) in this world!" but they will have no portion in the Hereafter.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002201">And there are men who say: "Our Lord! Give us good in this world and good in the Hereafter, and defend us from the torment of the Fire!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="002202">To these will be allotted what they have earned; and Allah is quick in account.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002203">Celebrate the praises of Allah during the Appointed Days. But if any one hastens to leave in two days, there is no blame on him, and if any one stays on, there is no blame on him, if his aim is to do right. Then fear Allah, and know that ye will surely be gathered unto Him.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002204">There is the type of man whose speech about this world's life may dazzle thee, and (on the sight of the people) he calls Allah to witness about what is in his heart; yet is he the most contentious of enemies.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002205">When he turns his back, His aim everywhere is to spread mischief through the earth and destroy crops and progeny. But Allah loveth not mischief.</AYA>

		<AYA id="002212">The life of this world is alluring to those who reject faith, and they scoff at those who believe. But the righteous will be above them on the Day of Resurrection; for Allah bestows His abundance without measure on whom He will.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002213">Mankind was one single nation, and Allah sent Messengers with glad tidings and warnings; and with them He sent the Book in truth, to judge between people in matters wherein they differed; but the People of the Book, after the clear Signs came to them, did not differ among themselves, except through selfish contumacy. Allah by His Grace Guided the believers to the Truth, concerning that wherein they differed. For Allah guided whom He will to a path that is straight.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002214">Or do ye think that ye shall enter the Garden (of Bliss) without such (trials) as came to those who passed away before you? they encountered suffering and adversity, and were so shaken in spirit that even the Messenger and those of faith who were with him cried: "When (will come) the help of Allah." Ah! Verily, the help of Allah is (always) near!</AYA>
		<AYA id="002215">They ask thee what they should spend (In charity). Say: Whatever wealth ye spend that is good, is for parents and kindred and orphans and those in want and for wayfarers. And whatever ye do that is good, -Allah knoweth it well.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002216">Fighting is prescribed for you, and ye dislike it. But it is possible that ye dislike a thing which is good for you, and that ye love a thing which is bad for you. But Allah knoweth, and ye know not.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002217">They ask thee concerning fighting in the Prohibited Month. Say: "Fighting therein is a grave (offense); but graver is it in the sight of Allah to prevent access to the path of Allah, to deny Him, to prevent access to the Sacred Mosque, and drive out its members." Tumult and oppression are worse than slaughter. Nor will they cease fighting you until they turn you back from your faith if they can. And if any of you turn back from their faith and die in unbelief, their works will bear no fruit in this life and in the Hereafter; they will be companions of the Fire and will abide therein.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002218">Those who believed and those who suffered exile and fought (and strove and struggled) in the path of Allah,- they have the hope of the Mercy of Allah. And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.</AYA>

They ask thee how much they are to spend; Say: "What is beyond your needs." Thus doth Allah make clear to you His Signs: In order that ye may consider-</AYA>
		<AYA id="002220">(Their bearings) on this life and the Hereafter. They ask thee concerning orphans. Say: "The best thing to do is what is for their good; if ye mix their affairs with yours, they are your brethren; but Allah knows the man who means mischief from the man who means good. And if Allah had wished, He could have put you into difficulties: He is indeed Exalted in Power, Wise."</AYA>
		<AYA id="002221">Do not marry unbelieving women (idolaters), until they believe: A slave woman who believes is better than an unbelieving woman, even though she allures you. Nor marry (your girls) to unbelievers until they believe: A man slave who believes is better than an unbeliever, even though he allures you. Unbelievers do (but) beckon you to the Fire. But Allah beckons by His Grace to the Garden (of Bliss) and forgiveness, and makes His Signs clear to mankind: That they may celebrate His praise.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002222">They ask thee concerning women's courses. Say: They are a hurt and a pollution: So keep away from women in their courses, and do not approach them until they are clean. But when they have purified themselves, ye may approach them as ordained for you by Allah. For Allah loves those who turn to Him constantly; and He loves those who keep themselves pure and clean.</AYA>

		<AYA id="002224">And make not Allah's (name) an excuse in your oaths against doing good, or acting rightly, or making peace between persons; for Allah is One Who heareth and knoweth all things.</AYA>

		<AYA id="002227">But if their intention is firm for divorce, Allah heareth and knoweth all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002228">Divorced women shall wait concerning themselves for three monthly periods. Nor is it lawful for them to hide what Allah Hath created in their wombs, if they have faith in Allah and the Last Day. And their husbands have the better right to take them back in that period, if they wish for reconciliation. And women shall have rights similar to the rights against them, according to what is equitable; but men have a degree (of advantage) over them. And Allah is Exalted in Power, Wise.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002229">A divorce is only permissible twice: after that, the parties should either hold together on equitable terms, or separate with kindness. It is not lawful for you, (men), to take back any of your gifts (from your wives), except when both parties fear that they would be unable to keep the limits ordained by Allah. If ye (judges) do indeed fear that they would be unable to keep the limits ordained by Allah, there is no blame on either of them if she give something for her freedom. These are the limits ordained by Allah. so do not transgress them if any do transgress the limits ordained by Allah, such persons wrong (themselves as well as others).</AYA>
		<AYA id="002230">So if a husband divorces his wife (irrevocably), he cannot, after that, re- marry her until after she has married another husband and he has divorced her. In that case there is no blame on either of them if they re-unite, provided they feel that they can keep the limits ordained by Allah. Such are the limits ordained by Allah, which He makes plain to those who understand.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002231">When ye divorce women, and they (are about to) fulfill the term of their (ddah), either take them back on equitable terms or set them free on equitable terms; but do not take them back to injure them, (or) to take undue advantage; if any one does that; he wrongs his own soul. Do not treat Allah's Signs as a jest, but solemnly rehearse Allah's favors on you, and the fact that He sent down to you the Book and Wisdom, for your instruction. And fear Allah, and know that Allah is well acquainted with all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002232">When ye divorce women, and they fulfill the term of their (ddah), do not prevent them from marrying their (former) husbands, if they mutually agree on equitable terms. This instruction is for all amongst you, who believe in Allah and the Last Day. That is (the course making for) most virtue and purity amongst you. And Allah knows, and ye know not.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002233">The mothers shall give suck to their offspring for two whole years, for him (the father) who desires to complete the term. But he shall bear the cost of their food and clothing on equitable terms. No soul shall have a burden laid on it greater than it can bear. No mother shall be treated unfairly on account of her child. Nor father on account of his child, an heir shall be chargeable in the same way. If they both decide on weaning, by mutual consent, and after due consultation, there is no blame on them. If ye decide on a foster-mother for your offspring, there is no blame on you, provided ye pay (the foster mother) what ye offered, on equitable terms. But fear Allah and know that Allah sees well what ye do.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002234">If any of you die and leave widows behind, they shall wait concerning themselves four months and ten days: When they have fulfilled their term, there is no blame on you if they dispose of themselves in a just and reasonable manner. And Allah is well acquainted with what ye do.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002235">There is no blame on you if ye make an indirect offer of betrothal or hold it in your hearts. Allah knows that ye cherish them in your hearts: But do not make a secret contract with them except in terms honorable, nor resolve on the tie of marriage till the term prescribed is fulfilled. And know that Allah Knoweth what is in your hearts, and take heed of Him; and know that Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Forbearing.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002236">There is no blame on you if ye divorce women before consummation or the fixation of their dower; but bestow on them (A suitable gift), the wealthy according to his means, and the poor according to his means;- a gift of a reasonable amount is due from those who wish to do the right thing.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002237">And if ye divorce them before consummation, but after the fixation of a dower for them, then the half of the dower (is due to them), unless they remit it or (the man's half) is remitted by him in whose hands is the marriage tie; and the remission (of the man's half) is the nearest to righteousness. And do not forget liberality between yourselves. For Allah sees well all that ye do.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002238">Guard strictly your (habit of) prayers, especially the Middle Prayer; and stand before Allah in a devout (frame of mind).</AYA>
		<AYA id="002239">If ye fear (an enemy), pray on foot, or riding, (as may be most convenient), but when ye are in security, celebrate Allah's praises in the manner He has taught you, which ye knew not (before).</AYA>
		<AYA id="002240">Those of you who die and leave widows should bequeath for their widows a year's maintenance and residence; but if they leave (the residence), there is no blame on you for what they do with themselves, provided it is reasonable. And Allah is Exalted in Power, Wise.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002241">For divorced women maintenance (should be provided) on a reasonable (scale). This is a duty on the righteous.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002242">Thus doth Allah make clear His Signs to you in order that ye may understand.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002243">Didst thou not turn by vision to those who abandoned their homes, though they were thousands (in number), for fear of death? Allah said to them: "Die": Then He restored them to life. For Allah is full of bounty to mankind, but Most of them are ungrateful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002244">Then fight in the Cause of Allah, and know that Allah Heareth and Knoweth all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002245">Who is he that will loan to Allah a beautiful loan, which Allah will double unto his credit and multiply many times? It is Allah that giveth (you) want or plenty, and to Him shall be your return.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002246">Has thou not turned thy vision to the Chiefs of the Children of Israel after (the time of) Moses? they said to a prophet (that was) among them: "Appoint for us a king, that we may fight in the cause of Allah." He said: "Is it not possible, if ye were commanded to fight, that ye will not fight?" They said: "How could we refuse to fight in the cause of Allah, seeing that we were turned out of our homes and our families?" but when they were commanded to fight, they turned back, except a small band among them. But Allah Has full knowledge of those who do wrong.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002247">Their Prophet said to them: "Allah hath appointed Talut as king over you." They said: "How can he exercise authority over us when we are better fitted than he to exercise authority, and he is not even gifted, with wealth in abundance?" He said: "Allah hath chosen him above you, and hath gifted him abundantly with knowledge and bodily prowess: Allah Granteth His authority to whom He pleaseth. Allah is All-Embracing, and He knoweth all things."</AYA>
		<AYA id="002248">And (further) their Prophet said to them: "A sign of his authority is that there shall come to you the Ark of the Covenant, with (an assurance) therein of security from your Lord, and the relics left by the family of Moses and the family of Aaron, carried by angels. In this is a symbol for you if ye indeed have faith."</AYA>
		<AYA id="002249">When Talut set forth with the armies, he said: "Allah will test you at the stream: if any drinks of its water, he goes not with my army: Only those who taste not of it go with me: A mere sip out of the hand is excused." But they all drank of it, except a few. When they crossed the river,- he and the faithful ones with him,- they said: "This day we cannot cope with Goliath and his forces." But those who were convinced that they must meet Allah, said: "How oft, by Allah's will, hath a small force vanquished a big one? Allah is with those who steadfastly persevere."</AYA>
		<AYA id="002250">When they advanced to meet Goliath and his forces, they prayed: "Our Lord! Pour out constancy on us and make our steps firm: Help us against those that reject faith."</AYA>
		<AYA id="002251">By Allah's will they routed them; and David slew Goliath; and Allah gave him power and wisdom and taught him whatever (else) He willed. And did not Allah check one set of people by means of another, the earth would indeed be full of mischief: But Allah is full of bounty to all the worlds.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002252">These are the Signs of Allah. we rehearse them to thee in truth: verily thou art one of the messengers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002253">Those messengers We endowed with gifts, some above others: To one of them Allah spoke; others He raised to degrees (of honor); to Jesus the son of Mary We gave clear (Signs), and strengthened him with the Holy Spirit. If Allah had so willed, succeeding generations would not have fought among each other, after clear (Signs) had come to them, but they (chose) to wrangle, some believing and others rejecting. If Allah had so willed, they would not have fought each other; but Allah Does what he wills.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002254">O ye who believe! Spend out of (the bounties) We have provided for you, before the Day comes when no bargaining (will avail), nor friendship nor intercession. Those who reject Faith- they are the wrong-doers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002255">Allah. There is no god but He,-the Living, the Self-subsisting, Supporter of all. No slumber can seize Him nor sleep. His are all things in the heavens and on earth. Who is thee can intercede in His presence except as He permitteth? He knoweth what (appeareth to His creatures as) before or after or behind them. Nor shall they compass aught of His knowledge except as He willeth. His Throne doth extend over the heavens and the earth, and He feeleth no fatigue in guarding and preserving them. For He is the Most High, the Supreme (in glory).</AYA>
		<AYA id="002256">Let there be no compulsion in religion: Truth stands out clear from Error: whoever rejects Taghut (evil) and believes in Allah hath grasped the most trustworthy hand-hold, that never breaks. And Allah heareth and knoweth all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002257">Allah is the Protector of those who have faith: from the depths of darkness He will lead them forth into light. Of those who reject faith the patrons are the Taghut (evil) ones: from light they will lead them forth into the depths of darkness. They will be companions of the Fire, to dwell therein (for ever).</AYA>
		<AYA id="002258">Hast thou not turned thy vision to one who disputed with Abraham about his Lord, because Allah had granted him power? Abraham said: "My Lord is He Who Giveth life and death." He said: "I give life and death". Said Abraham: "But it is Allah that causeth the sun to rise from the east: Do thou then cause it to rise from the west." Thus was he confounded who (in arrogance) rejected faith. Nor doth Allah Give guidance to a people unjust.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002259">Or (take) the similitude of one who passed by a hamlet, all in ruins to its roofs. He said: "Oh! how shall Allah bring it (ever) to life, after (this) its death?" But Allah caused him to die for a hundred years, then raised him up (again). He said: "How long didst thou tarry (thus)?" He said: (Perhaps) a day or part of a day." He said: "Nay, thou hast tarried thus a hundred years; but look at thy food and thy drink; they show no signs of age; and look at thy donkey: and that We may make of thee a sign unto the people. Look further at the bones, how We bring them together and clothe them with flesh." When this was shown clearly to him, he said: "I know that Allah hath power over all things."</AYA>
		<AYA id="002260">Behold! Abraham said: "My Lord! Show me how Thou givest life to the dead." He said: "Dost thou not then believe?" He said: "Yea! but to satisfy my own heart." He said: "Take four birds; tie them (cut them into pieces); then put a portion of them on every hill and call to them: They will come to thee (flying) with speed. Then know that Allah is Exalted in Power, Wise."</AYA>
		<AYA id="002261">The parable of those who spend their wealth in the way of Allah is that of a grain of corn: it groweth seven ears, and each ear Hath a hundred grains. Allah giveth manifold increase to whom He pleaseth: And Allah careth for all and He knoweth all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002262">Those who spend their substance in the cause of Allah, and follow not up their gifts with reminders of their generosity or with injury,-for them their reward is with their Lord: on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002263">Kind words and the covering of faults are better than charity followed by injury. Allah is free of all wants, and He is Most-Forbearing.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002264">O ye who believe! cancel not your charity by reminders of your generosity or by injury,- like those who spend their wealth to be seen of men, but believe neither in Allah nor in the Last Day. They are in parable like a hard, barren rock, on which is a little soil: on it falls heavy rain, which leaves it (just) a bare stone. They will be able to do nothing with aught they have earned. And Allah guideth not those who reject faith.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002265">And the likeness of those who spend their substance, seeking to please Allah and to strengthen their souls, is as a garden, high and fertile: heavy rain falls on it but makes it yield a double increase of harvest, and if it receives not heavy rain, light moisture sufficeth it. Allah seeth well whatever ye do.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002266">Does any of you wish that he should have a garden with date-palms and vines and streams flowing underneath, and all kinds of fruit, while he is stricken with old age, and his children are not strong (enough to look after themselves)- that it should be caught in a whirlwind, with fire therein, and be burnt up? Thus doth Allah make clear to you (His) Signs; that ye may consider.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002267">O ye who believe! Give of the good things which ye have (honorably) earned, and of the fruits of the earth which We have produced for you, and do not even aim at getting anything which is bad, in order that out of it ye may give away something, when ye yourselves would not receive it except with closed eyes. And know that Allah is Free of all wants, and Worthy of all praise.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002268">The Satan threatens you with poverty and bids you to conduct unseemly. Allah promiseth you His forgiveness and bounties. And Allah careth for all and He knoweth all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002269">He granteth wisdom to whom He pleaseth; and he to whom wisdom is granted receiveth indeed a benefit overflowing; but none will grasp the Message but men of understanding.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002270">And whatever ye spend in charity or whatever vow ye make, be sure Allah knows it all. But the wrong-doers have no helpers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002271">If ye disclose (acts of) charity, even so it is well, but if ye conceal them, and make them reach those (really) in need, that is best for you: It will remove from you some of your (stains of) evil. And Allah is well acquainted with what ye do.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002272">It is not required of thee (O Messenger.), to set them on the right path, but Allah sets on the right path whom He pleaseth. Whatever of good ye give benefits your own souls, and ye shall only do so seeking the "Face" of Allah. Whatever good ye give, shall be rendered back to you, and ye shall not be dealt with unjustly.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002273">(Charity is) for those in need, who, in Allah's cause are restricted (from travel), and cannot move about in the land, seeking (for trade or work): the ignorant man thinks, because of their modesty, that they are free from want. Thou shalt know them by their (unfailing) mark: They beg not importunately from all the sundry. And whatever of good ye give, be assured Allah knoweth it well.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002274">Those who (in charity) spend of their goods by night and by day, in secret and in public, have their reward with their Lord: on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002275">Those who devour usury will not stand except as stand one whom the Satan by his touch Hath driven to madness. That is because they say: "Trade is like usury," but Allah hath permitted trade and forbidden usury. Those who after receiving direction from their Lord, desist, shall be pardoned for the past; their case is for Allah (to judge); but those who repeat (the offense) are companions of the Fire: They will abide therein (for ever).</AYA>
		<AYA id="002276">Allah will deprive usury of all blessing, but will give increase for deeds of charity: For He loveth not any ungrateful and wicked.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002277">Those who believe, and do deeds of righteousness, and establish regular prayers and regular charity, will have their reward with their Lord: On them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002278">O ye who believe! Fear Allah, and give up what remains of your demand for usury, if ye are indeed believers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002279">If ye do it not, take notice of war from Allah and His Messenger. But if ye repent, ye shall have your capital sums: Deal not unjustly, and ye shall not be dealt with unjustly.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002280">If the debtor is in a difficulty, grant him time till it is easy for him to repay. But if ye remit it by way of charity, that is best for you if ye only knew.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002281">And fear the Day when ye shall be brought back to Allah. Then shall every soul be paid what it earned, and none shall be dealt with unjustly.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002282">O ye who believe! When ye deal with each other, in transactions involving future obligations in a fixed period of time, reduce them to writing. Let a scribe write down faithfully as between the parties: let not the scribe refuse to write: as Allah Has taught him, so let him write. Let him who incurs the liability dictate, but let him fear His Lord Allah, and not diminish aught of what he owes. If the party liable is mentally deficient, or weak, or unable himself to dictate, let his guardian dictate faithfully. And get two witnesses, out of your own men, and if there are not two men, then a man and two women, such as ye choose, for witnesses, so that if one of them errs, the other can remind her. The witnesses should not refuse when they are called on (for evidence). Disdain not to reduce to writing (your contract) for a future period, whether it be small or big; it is juster in the sight of Allah, more suitable as evidence, and more convenient to prevent doubts among yourselves but if it be a transaction which ye carry out on the spot among yourselves, there is no blame on you if ye reduce it not to writing. But take witness whenever ye make a commercial contract; and let neither scribe nor witness suffer harm. If ye do (such harm), it would be wickedness in you. So fear Allah. For it is Allah that teaches you. And Allah is well acquainted with all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002283">If ye are on a journey, and cannot find a scribe, a pledge with possession (may serve the purpose). And if one of you deposits a thing on trust with another, Let the trustee (faithfully) discharge his trust, and let him fear Allah, his Lord. Conceal not evidence; for whoever conceals it,- His heart is tainted with sin. And Allah Knoweth all that ye do.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002284">To Allah belongeth all that is in the heavens and on earth. Whether ye show what is in your minds or conceal it, Allah Calleth you to account for it. He forgiveth whom He pleaseth, and punisheth whom He pleaseth, for Allah hath power over all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002285">The Messenger believeth in what hath been revealed to him from his Lord, as do the men of faith. Each one (of them) believeth in Allah, His angels, His books, and His messengers. "We make no distinction (they say) between one and another of His messengers." And they say: "We hear, and we obey: (we seek) Thy forgiveness, our Lord, and to Thee is the end of all journeys."</AYA>
		<AYA id="002286">On no soul doth Allah place a burden greater than it can bear. It gets every good that it earns, and it suffers every ill that it earns. (Pray:) "Our Lord! Condemn us not if we forget or fall into error; our Lord! Lay not on us a burden like that which Thou didst lay on those before us; Our Lord! Lay not on us a burden greater than we have strength to bear. Blot out our sins, and grant us forgiveness. Have mercy on us. Thou art our Protector; Grant us victory over the unbelievers."</AYA>

But Allah doth support with His aid whom He pleaseth. In this is a lesson for such as have eyes to see."</AYA>
		<AYA id="003014">Fair in the eyes of men is the love of things they covet: Women and sons; Heaped-up hoards of gold and silver; horses branded (for blood and excellence); and (wealth of) cattle and well-tilled land.

If then they turn back, say ye: "Bear witness that we (at least) are Muslims (bowing to Allah's Will)."</AYA>
		<AYA id="003065">Ye People of the Book! Why dispute ye about Abraham, when the Torah and the Gospel Were not revealed till after him? Have ye no understanding?</AYA>
		<AYA id="003066">Ah! Ye are those who fell to disputing (even) in matters of which ye had some knowledge! But why dispute ye in matters of which ye have no knowledge? It is Allah Who knows, and ye who know not!</AYA>
		<AYA id="003067">Abraham was not a Jew nor yet a Christian; but he was true in Faith, and bowed his will to Allah's (which is Islm), and he joined not gods with Allah.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003068">Without doubt, among men, the nearest of kin to Abraham, are those who follow him, as are also this Prophet and those who believe: And Allah is the Protector of those who have faith.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003069">It is the wish of a section of the People of the Book to lead you astray. But they shall lead astray (not you), but themselves, and they do not perceive!</AYA>
		<AYA id="003070">Ye People of the Book! Why reject ye the Signs of Allah, of which ye are (yourselves) witnesses?</AYA>
		<AYA id="003071">Ye People of the Book! Why do ye clothe truth with falsehood, and conceal the truth, while ye have knowledge?</AYA>
		<AYA id="003072">A section of the People of the Book say: "Believe in the morning what is revealed to the believers, but reject it at the end of the day; perchance they may (themselves) turn back;</AYA>
		<AYA id="003073">"And believe no one unless he follows your religion." Say: "True guidance is the Guidance of Allah. (Fear ye) lest a revelation be sent to someone (else) like unto that which was sent unto you? or that those (receiving such revelation) should engage you in argument before your Lord?" Say: "All bounties are in the hand of Allah. He granteth them to whom He pleaseth: And Allah careth for all, and He knoweth all things."</AYA>
		<AYA id="003074">For His Mercy He specially chooseth whom He pleaseth; for Allah is the Lord of bounties unbounded.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003075">Among the People of the Book are some who, if entrusted with a hoard of gold, will (readily) pay it back; others, who, if entrusted with a single silver coin, will not repay it unless thou constantly stoodest demanding, because, they say, "there is no call on us (to keep faith) with these ignorant (people)." But they tell a lie against Allah, and (well) they know it.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003076">Nay, - Those that keep their plighted faith and act aright,-verily Allah loves those who act aright.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003077">As for those who sell the faith they owe to Allah and their own plighted word for a small price, they shall have no portion in the Hereafter: Nor will Allah (Deign to) speak to them or look at them on the Day of Judgment, nor will He cleans them (of sin): They shall have a grievous penalty.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003078">There is among them a section who distort the Book with their tongues: (As they read) you would think it is a part of the Book, but it is no part of the Book; and they say, "That is from Allah," but it is not from Allah. It is they who tell a lie against Allah, and (well) they know it!</AYA>
		<AYA id="003079">It is not (possible) that a man, to whom is given the Book, and Wisdom, and the Prophetic Office, should say to people: "Be ye my worshippers rather than Allah's": On the contrary (he would say) "Be ye worshippers of Him (Who is truly the Cherisher of all): For ye have taught the Book and ye have studied it earnestly."</AYA>
		<AYA id="003080">Nor would he instruct you to take angels and prophets for Lords and patrons. What! would he bid you to unbelief after ye have bowed your will (to Allah in Islm)?</AYA>
		<AYA id="003081">Behold! Allah took the covenant of the prophets, saying: "I give you a Book and Wisdom; then comes to you a messenger, confirming what is with you; do ye believe in him and render him help." Allah said: "Do ye agree, and take this my Covenant as binding on you?" They said: "We agree." He said: "Then bear witness, and I am with you among the witnesses."</AYA>
		<AYA id="003082">If any turn back after this, they are perverted transgressors.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003083">Do they seek for other than the Religion of Allah? - while all creatures in the heavens and on earth have, willing or unwilling, bowed to His Will (accepted Islm), and to Him shall they all be brought back.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003084">Say: "We believe in Allah, and in what has been revealed to us and what was revealed to Abraham, Ismail, Isaac, Jacob, and the Tribes, and in (the Books) given to Moses, Jesus, and the Prophets, from their Lord: We make no distinction between one and another among them, and to Allah do we bow our will (in Islm)."</AYA>
		<AYA id="003085">If anyone desires a religion other than Islm (submission to Allah), never will it be accepted of him; and in the Hereafter He will be in the ranks of those who have lost.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003086">How shall Allah Guide those who reject Faith after they accepted it and bore witness that the Messenger was true and that Clear Signs had come unto them? but Allah guides not a people unjust.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003087">Of such the reward is that on them (rests) the curse of Allah, of His angels, and of all mankind;-</AYA>
		<AYA id="003088">In that will they dwell; nor will their punishment be lightened, nor respite be their (lot);-</AYA>
		<AYA id="003089">Except for those that repent (even) after that, and make amends; for verily Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003090">But those who reject Faith after they accepted it, and then go on adding to their defiance of Faith,- never will their repentance be accepted; for they are those who have (of set purpose) gone astray.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003091">As to those who reject Faith, and die rejecting,- never would be accepted from any such as much gold as the earth contains, though they should offer it for ransom. For such is (in store) a penalty grievous, and they will find no helpers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003092">By no means shall ye attain righteousness unless ye give (freely) of that which ye love; and whatever ye give, Allah knoweth it well.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003093">All food was lawful to the Children of Israel, except what Israel (Jacob) made unlawful for himself, before the Torah (of Moses) was revealed. Say: "Bring ye the Torah and study it, if ye be men of truth."</AYA>
		<AYA id="003094">If any, after this, invent a lie and attribute it to Allah, they are indeed unjust wrong-doers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003095">Say: "Allah speaketh the Truth: follow the religion of Abraham, the sane in faith; he was not of the Pagans."</AYA>
		<AYA id="003096">The first House (of worship) appointed for men was that at Bakka: Full of blessing and of guidance for all the worlds.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003097">In it are Signs Manifest; (for example), the Station of Abraham; whoever enters it attains security; Pilgrimage thereto is a duty men owe to Allah,- those who can afford the journey; but if any deny faith, Allah stands not in need of any of His creatures.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003098">Say: "O People of the Book! Why reject ye the Signs of Allah, when Allah is Himself witness to all ye do?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="003099">Say: "O ye People of the Book! Why obstruct ye those who believe, from the path of Allah, seeking to make it crooked, while ye were yourselves witnesses (to Allah's Covenant)? But Allah is not unmindful of all that ye do."</AYA>
		<AYA id="003100">O ye who believe! If ye listen to a faction among the People of the Book, they would (indeed) render you apostates after ye have believed!</AYA>
		<AYA id="003101">And how would ye deny Faith while unto you are rehearsed the Signs of Allah, and among you lives the Messenger. Whoever holds firmly to Allah will be shown a way that is straight.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003102">O ye who believe! Fear Allah as He should be feared, and die not except in a state of Islm.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003103">And hold fast, all together, by the Rope which Allah (stretches out for you), and be not divided among yourselves; and remember with gratitude Allah's favor on you; for ye were enemies and He joined your hearts in love, so that by His Grace, ye became brethren; and ye were on the brink of the pit of Fire, and He saved you from it. Thus doth Allah make His Signs clear to you that ye may be guided.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003104">Let there arise out of you a band of people inviting to all that is good, enjoining what is right, and forbidding what is wrong: They are the ones to attain felicity.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003105">Be not like those who are divided amongst themselves and fall into disputations after receiving Clear Signs: For them is a dreadful penalty,-</AYA>
		<AYA id="003106">On the Day when some faces will be (lit up with) white, and some faces will be (in the gloom of) black: To those whose faces will be black, (will be said): "Did ye reject Faith after accepting it? Taste then the penalty for rejecting Faith."</AYA>
		<AYA id="003107">But those whose faces will be (lit with) white,- they will be in (the light of) Allah's mercy: therein to dwell (for ever).</AYA>
		<AYA id="003108">These are the Signs of Allah. We rehearse them to thee in Truth: And Allah means no injustice to any of His creatures.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003109">To Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and on earth: To Allah matters return.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003110">Ye are the best of peoples, evolved for mankind, enjoining what is right, forbidding what is wrong, and believing in Allah. If only the People of the Book had faith, it were best for them: among them are some who have faith, but most of them are perverted transgressors.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003111">They will do you no harm, barring a trifling annoyance; if they come out to fight you, they will show you their backs, and no help shall they get.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003112">Shame is pitched over them (like a tent) wherever they are found, except when under a covenant (of protection) from Allah and from men; they draw on themselves wrath from Allah, and pitched over them is (the tent of) destitution. This because they rejected the Signs of Allah, and slew the prophets in defiance of right; this because they rebelled and transgressed beyond bounds.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003113">Not all of them are alike: Of the People of the Book are a portion that stand (for the right): They rehearse the Signs of Allah all night long, and they prostrate themselves in adoration.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003114">They believe in Allah and the Last Day; they enjoin what is right, and forbid what is wrong; and they hasten (in emulation) in (all) good works: They are in the ranks of the righteous.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003115">Of the good that they do, nothing will be rejected of them; for Allah knoweth well those that do right.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003116">Those who reject Faith,- neither their possessions nor their (numerous) progeny will avail them aught against Allah. They will be companions of the Fire,- dwelling therein (for ever).</AYA>
		<AYA id="003117">What they spend in the life of this (material) world may be likened to a wind which brings a nipping frost: It strikes and destroys the harvest of men who have wronged their own souls: it is not Allah that hath wronged them, but they wrong themselves.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003118">O ye who believe! Take not into your intimacy those outside your ranks: They will not fail to corrupt you. They only desire for you to suffer: Rank hatred has already appeared from their mouths: What their hearts conceal is far worse. We have made plain to you the Signs, if ye have wisdom.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003119">Ah! ye are those who love them, but they love you not,- though ye believe in the whole of the Book. When they meet you, they say, "We believe": But when they are alone, they bite off the very tips of their fingers at you in their rage. Say: "Perish in your rage; Allah knoweth well all the secrets of the heart."</AYA>
		<AYA id="003120">If aught that is good befalls you, it grieves them; but if some misfortune overtakes you, they rejoice at it. But if ye are patient and do right, not the least harm will their cunning do to you; for Allah Compasseth round about all that they do.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003121">(Remember that morning) thou didst leave thy household (early) to post the faithful at their stations for battle: And Allah heareth and knoweth all things:</AYA>
		<AYA id="003122">Remember two of your parties Meditated cowardice; but Allah was their protector, and in Allah should the faithful (ever) put their trust.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003123">Allah had helped you at Badr, when ye were a contemptible little force; then fear Allah. thus may ye show your gratitude.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003124">Remember thou saidst to the faithful: "Is it not enough for you that Allah should help you with three thousand angels (Specially) sent down?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="003125">"Yea, - if ye remain firm, and act aright, even if the enemy should rush here on you in hot haste, your Lord would help you with five thousand angels clearly marked.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003126">Allah made it but a message of hope for you, and an assurance to your hearts: (in any case) there is no help except from Allah. The Exalted, the Wise:</AYA>
		<AYA id="003127">That He might cut off a fringe of the unbelievers or expose them to infamy, and they should then be turned back, frustrated of their purpose.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003128">Not for thee, (but for Allah), is the decision: Whether He turn in mercy to them, or punish them; for they are indeed wrong-doers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003129">To Allah belongeth all that is in the heavens and on earth. He forgiveth whom He pleaseth and punisheth whom He pleaseth; but Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003130">O ye who believe! Devour not usury, doubled and multiplied; but fear Allah. that ye may (really) prosper.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003131">And fear the Fire, which is repaired for those who reject Faith:</AYA>
		<AYA id="003132">And obey Allah and the Messenger; that ye may obtain mercy.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003133">Be quick in the race for forgiveness from your Lord, and for a Garden whose width is that (of the whole) of the heavens and of the earth, prepared for the righteous,-</AYA>
		<AYA id="003134">Those who spend (freely), whether in prosperity, or in adversity; who restrain anger, and pardon (all) men;- for Allah loves those who do good;-</AYA>
		<AYA id="003135">And those who, having done an act of indecency to be ashamed of, or wronged their own souls, remember Allah, and ask for forgiveness for their sins,- and who can forgive sins except Allah? - and are never obstinate in persisting knowingly in (the wrong) they have done.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003136">For such the reward is forgiveness from their Lord, and Gardens with rivers flowing underneath,- an eternal dwelling: How excellent a recompense for those who work (and strive)!</AYA>
		<AYA id="003137">There have been examples that have passed away before you: Travel through the earth, and see what was the end of those who rejected Truth.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003138">Here is a plain statement to men, a guidance and instruction to those who fear Allah.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003139">So lose not heart, nor fall into despair: For ye must gain mastery if ye are true in Faith.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003140">If a wound hath touched you, be sure a similar wound hath touched the others. Such days (of varying fortunes) We give to men and men by turns: that Allah may know those that believe, and that He may take to Himself from your ranks martyr-witnesses (to truth). And Allah loveth not those that do wrong.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003141">Allah's object also is to purge those that are true in Faith and to deprive of blessing those that resist Faith.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003142">Did ye think that ye would enter Heaven without Allah testing those of you who fought hard (In His Cause) and remained steadfast?</AYA>
		<AYA id="003143">Ye did indeed wish for death before ye met him: Now ye have seen it with your own eyes, (and ye flinch!)</AYA>
		<AYA id="003144">Muhammad is no more than a messenger: many were the a messengers that passed away before him. Is it that if he died or were slain, will ye then turn back on your heels? If any did turn back on his heels, not the least harm will he do to Allah. But Allah (on the other hand) will swiftly reward those who (serve Him) with gratitude.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003145">Nor can a soul die except by Allah's leave, the term being fixed as by writing. If any do desire a reward in this life, We shall give it to him; and if any do desire a reward in the Hereafter, We shall give it to him. And swiftly shall We reward those that (serve us with) gratitude.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003146">How many of the prophets fought (in Allah's way), and with them (fought) large bands of godly men? But they never lost heart if they met with disaster in Allah's way, nor did they weaken (in will) nor give in. And Allah Loves those who are firm and steadfast.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003147">All that they said was: "Our Lord! Forgive us our sins and anything we may have done that transgressed our duty: Establish our feet firmly, and help us against those that resist Faith."</AYA>
		<AYA id="003148">And Allah gave them a reward in this world, and the excellent reward of the Hereafter. For Allah Loveth those who do good.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003149">O ye who believe! If ye obey the unbelievers, they will drive you back on your heels, and ye will turn back (from Faith) to your own loss.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003150">Nay, Allah is your Protector, and He is the best of helpers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003151">Soon shall We cast terror into the hearts of the unbelievers, for that they joined companions with Allah, for which He had sent no authority: their abode will be the Fire: And evil is the home of the wrong-doers!</AYA>
		<AYA id="003152">Allah did indeed fulfill His promise to you when ye with His permission were about to annihilate your enemy,-until ye flinched and fell to disputing about the order, and disobeyed it after He brought you in sight (of the booty) which ye covet. Among you are some that hanker after this world and some that desire the Hereafter. Then did He divert you from your foes in order to test you But He forgave you: For Allah is full of grace to those who believe.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003153">Behold! ye were climbing up the high ground, without even casting a side glance at any one, and the Messenger in your rear was calling you back. There did Allah give you one distress after another by way of requital, to teach you not to grieve for (the booty) that had escaped you and for (the ill) that had befallen you. For Allah is well aware of all that ye do.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003154">After (the excitement) of the distress, He sent down calm on a band of you overcome with slumber, while another band was stirred to anxiety by their own feelings, moved by wrong suspicions of Allah - suspicions due to ignorance. They said: "What affair is this of ours?" Say thou: "Indeed, this affair is wholly Allah's." They hide in their minds what they dare not reveal to thee. They say (to themselves): "If we had had anything to do with this affair, We should not have been in the slaughter here." Say: "Even if you had remained in your homes, those for whom death was decreed would certainly have gone forth to the place of their death"; but (all this was) that Allah might test what is in your breasts and purge what is in your hearts. For Allah knoweth well the secrets of your hearts.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003155">Those of you who turned back on the day the two hosts met,-it was Satan who caused them to fail, because of some (evil) they had done. But Allah Has blotted out (their fault): For Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Forbearing.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003156">O ye who believe! Be not like the unbelievers, who say of their brethren, when they are traveling through the earth or engaged in fighting: "If they had stayed with us, they would not have died, or been slain." This that Allah may make it a cause of sighs and regrets in their hearts. It is Allah that gives Life and Death, and Allah sees well all that ye do.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003157">And if ye are slain, or die, in the way of Allah, forgiveness and mercy from Allah are far better than all they could amass :</AYA>
		<AYA id="003158">And if ye die, or are slain, Lo! it is unto Allah that ye are brought together.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003159">It is part of the Mercy of Allah that thou dost deal gently with them. Wert thou severe or harsh-hearted, they would have broken away from about thee: so pass over (their faults), and ask for (Allah's) forgiveness for them; and consult them in affairs (of moment). Then, when thou hast taken a decision put thy trust in Allah. For Allah loves those who put their trust (in Him).</AYA>
		<AYA id="003160">If Allah helps you, none can overcome you: If He forsakes you, who is there, after that, that can help you? In Allah, then, let believers put their trust.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003161">No prophet could (ever) be false to his trust. If any person is so false, He shall, on the Day of Judgment, restore what he misappropriated; then shall every soul receive its due,- whatever it earned,- and none shall be dealt with unjustly.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003162">Is the man who follows the good pleasure of Allah like the man who draws on himself the wrath of Allah, and whose abode is in Hell?- A woeful refuge!</AYA>
		<AYA id="003163">They are in varying grades in the sight of Allah, and Allah sees well all that they do.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003164">Allah did confer a great favor on the believers when He sent among them a messenger from among themselves, rehearsing unto them the Signs of Allah, sanctifying them, and instructing them in Scripture and Wisdom, while, before that, they had been in manifest error.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003165">What! When a single disaster smites you, although ye smote (your enemies) with one twice as great, do ye say?- "Whence is this?" Say (to them): "It is from yourselves: For Allah hath power over all things."</AYA>
		<AYA id="003166">What ye suffered on the day the two armies met, was with the leave of Allah, in order that He might test the believers,-</AYA>
		<AYA id="003167">And the Hypocrites also. These were told: "Come, fight in the way of Allah, or (at least) drive (the foe from your city)." They said: "Had we known there would be a fight, we should certainly have followed you." They were that day nearer to Unbelief than to Faith, saying with their lips what was not in their hearts. But Allah hath full knowledge of all they conceal.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003168">(They are) the ones that say, (of their brethren slain), while they themselves sit (at ease): "If only they had listened to us they would not have been slain." Say: "Avert death from your own selves, if ye speak the truth."</AYA>
		<AYA id="003169">Think not of those who are slain in Allah's way as dead. Nay, they live, finding their sustenance in the presence of their Lord;</AYA>
		<AYA id="003170">They rejoice in the bounty provided by Allah. And with regard to those left behind, who have not yet joined them (in their bliss), the (martyrs) glory in the fact that on them is no fear, nor have they (cause to) grieve.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003171">They glory in the Grace and the bounty from Allah, and in the fact that Allah suffereth not the reward of the Faithful to be lost (in the least).</AYA>
		<AYA id="003172">Of those who answered the call of Allah and the Messenger, even after being wounded, those who do right and refrain from wrong have a great reward;-</AYA>
		<AYA id="003173">Those to whom men said: "A great army is gathering against you, so fear them!". But it (only) increased their Faith: They said: "For us Allah sufficeth, and He is the best Guardian."</AYA>
		<AYA id="003174">And they returned with Grace and bounty from Allah.: no harm ever touched them: For they followed the good pleasure of Allah. And Allah is the Lord of bounties unbounded.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003175">It is only Satan suggests to you the fear of his votaries: Be ye not afraid of them, but fear Me, if ye have faith.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003176">Let not those grieve thee who rush headlong into Unbelief: Not the least harm will they do to Allah. Allah's plan is that He will give them no portion in the Hereafter, but a severe punishment.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003177">Those who purchase Unbelief at the price of faith,- not the least harm will they do to Allah, but they will have a grievous punishment.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003178">Let not the Unbelievers think that our respite to them is good for themselves: We grant them respite that they may grow in their iniquity: But they will have a shameful punishment.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003179">Allah will not leave the believers in the state in which ye are now, until He separates what is evil from what is good. Nor will He disclose to you the secrets of the Unseen. But He chooses of His Messengers (for the purpose) whom He pleases. So believe in Allah, and His messengers: And if ye believe and do right, ye have a great reward (without measure).</AYA>
		<AYA id="003180">And let not those who covetously withhold of the gifts which Allah Hath given them of His Grace, think that it is good for them: Nay, it will be the worse for them: soon shall the things which they covetously withheld be tied to their necks like a twisted collar, on the Day of Judgment. To Allah belongs the heritage of the heavens and the earth; and Allah is well-acquainted with all that ye do.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003181">Allah hath heard the taunt of those who say: "Truly, Allah is indigent and we are rich!"- We shall certainly record their word and (their act) of slaying the prophets in defiance of right, and We shall say: "Taste ye the penalty of the Scorching Fire!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="003182">"This is because of the (unrighteous deeds) which your hands sent on before ye: For Allah never do injustice to His servants."</AYA>
		<AYA id="003183">They (also) said: "Allah took our promise not to believe in a messenger unless he showed us a sacrifice consumed by Fire (from heaven)." Say: "There came to you messengers before me, with clear Signs and even with what ye ask for: why then did ye slay them, if ye speak the truth?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="003184">Then if they reject thee, so were rejected messengers before thee, who came with Clear Signs, The Scriptures, and the Book of Enlightenment.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003185">Every soul shall have the taste of death: And only on the Day of Judgment shall you be paid your full recompense. Only he who is saved far from the Fire and admitted to the Garden will have succeeded: For the life of this world is but goods and chattels of deception.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003186">Ye shall certainly be tried and tested in your possessions and in your personal selves; and ye shall certainly hear much that will grieve you, from those who received the Book before you and from those who worship partners besides Allah. But if ye persevere patiently, and guard against evil,-then that will be of great resolution.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003187">And remember Allah took a Covenant from the People of the Book, to make it known and clear to mankind, and not to hide it; but they threw it away behind their backs, and purchased with it some miserable gain! And vile was the bargain they made!</AYA>
		<AYA id="003188">Think not that those who exult in what they have brought about, and love to be praised for what they have not done,- think not that they can escape the penalty. For them is a penalty grievous indeed.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003189">To Allah belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth; and Allah hath power over all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003190">Behold! In the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the alternation of night and day,- there are indeed Signs for men of understanding,-</AYA>
		<AYA id="003191">Men who celebrate the praises of Allah, standing, sitting, and lying down on their sides, and contemplate the (wonders of) creation in the heavens and the earth, (with the thought): "Our Lord! Not for naught Hast Thou created (all) this! Glory to Thee! Give us salvation from the Chastisement of the Fire."</AYA>
		<AYA id="003192">"Our Lord! any whom Thou dost admit to the Fire, truly Thou coverest with shame, and never will wrong-doers find any helpers!</AYA>
		<AYA id="003193">"Our Lord! we have heard the call of one calling (us) to Faith, 'Believe ye in the Lord,' and we have believed. Our Lord! Forgive us our sins, blot out from us our iniquities, and take to Thyself our souls in the company of the righteous.</AYA>

	<SOURA id="4" name="Women">
		<AYA id="004001">O mankind! fear your Guardian Lord, Who created you from a single person, created out of it his mate, and from them twain scattered (like seeds) countless men and women;- fear Allah, through Whom ye demand your mutual (rights), and (be heedful) the wombs (that bore you): for Allah ever watches over you.</AYA>
		<AYA id="004002">To orphans restore their property (when they reach their age), nor substitute (your) worthless things for (their) good ones; and devour not their substance (by mixing it up) with your own. For this is indeed a great sin.</AYA>
		<AYA id="004003">If ye fear that ye shall not be able to deal justly with the orphans, marry women of your choice, two or three or four; but if ye fear that ye shall not be able to deal justly (with them), then only one, or (a captive) that your right hands possess, that will be more suitable, to prevent you from doing injustice.</AYA>
		<AYA id="004004">And give the women (on marriage) their dower as a free gift; but if they, of their own good pleasure, remit any part of it to you, take it and enjoy it with right good cheer.</AYA>
		<AYA id="004005">To those weak of understanding give not your property which Allah has assigned to you to manage, but feed and clothe them therewith, and speak to them words of kindness and justice.</AYA>
		<AYA id="004006">Make trial of orphans until they reach the age of marriage; if then ye find sound judgment in them, release their property to them; but consume it not wastefully, nor in haste against their growing up. If the guardian is well-off, let him claim no remuneration, but if he is poor, let him have for himself what is just and reasonable. When ye release their property to them, take witnesses in their presence: But all-sufficient is Allah in taking account.</AYA>
		<AYA id="004007">From what is left by parents and those nearest related there is a share for men and a share for women, whether the property be small or large,-a determinate share.</AYA>
		<AYA id="004008">But if at the time of division other relatives, or orphans or poor, are present, give them out of the (property), and speak to them words of kindness and justice.</AYA>
		<AYA id="004009">Let those (disposing of an estate) have the same fear in their minds as they would have for their own if they had left a helpless family behind: Let them fear Allah, and speak words of appropriate (comfort).</AYA>
		<AYA id="004010">Those who unjustly eat up the property of orphans, eat up a Fire into their own bodies: They will soon be enduring a Blazing Fire!</AYA>
		<AYA id="004011">Allah (thus) directs you as regards your children's (inheritance): to the male, a portion equal to that of two females: if only daughters, two or more, their share is two-thirds of the inheritance; if only one, her share is a half. For parents, a sixth share of the inheritance to each, if the deceased left children; if no children, and the parents are the (only) heirs, the mother has a third; if the deceased left brothers (or sisters) the mother has a sixth. (The distribution in all cases is) after the payment of legacies and debts. Ye know not whether your parents or your children are nearest to you in benefit. These are settled portions ordained by Allah: and Allah is All-Knowing, All-wise.</AYA>
		<AYA id="004012">In what your wives leave, your share is a half, if they leave no child; but if they leave a child, ye get a fourth; after payment of legacies and debts. In what ye leave, their share is a fourth, if ye leave no child; but if ye leave a child, they get an eighth; after payment of legacies and debts. If the man or woman whose inheritance is in question, has left neither ascendants nor descendants, but has left a brother or a sister, each one of the two gets a sixth; but if more than two, they share in a third; after payment of legacies and debts; so that no loss is caused (to any one). Thus is it ordained by Allah; and Allah is All- Knowing, Most Forbearing.</AYA>
		<AYA id="004013">Those are limits set by Allah. those who obey Allah and His Messenger will be admitted to Gardens with rivers flowing beneath, to abide therein (for ever) and that will be the supreme achievement.</AYA>
		<AYA id="004014">But those who disobey Allah and His Messenger and transgress His limits will be admitted to a Fire, to abide therein: And they shall have a humiliating punishment.</AYA>
		<AYA id="004015">If any of your women are guilty of lewdness, take the evidence of four (reliable) witnesses from amongst you against them; and if they testify, confine them to houses until death do claim them, or Allah ordain for them some (other) way.</AYA>
		<AYA id="004016">If two men among you are guilty of lewdness, punish them both. If they repent and amend, leave them alone; for Allah is Oft-returning, Most Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="004017">Allah accept the repentance of those who do evil in ignorance and repent soon afterwards; to them will Allah turn in mercy: For Allah is full of knowledge and wisdom.</AYA>
		<AYA id="004018">Of no effect is the repentance of those who continue to do evil, until death faces one of them, and he says, "Now have I repented indeed;" nor of those who die rejecting Faith: for them have We prepared a punishment most grievous.</AYA>
		<AYA id="004019">O ye who believe! Ye are forbidden to inherit women against their will. Nor should ye treat them with harshness, that ye may take away part of the dower ye have given them,-except where they have been guilty of open lewdness; on the contrary live with them on a footing of kindness and equity. If ye take a dislike to them it may be that ye dislike a thing, and Allah brings about through it a great deal of good.</AYA>
		<AYA id="004020">But if ye decide to take one wife in place of another, even if ye had given the latter a whole treasure for dower, take not the least bit of it back: Would ye take it by slander and manifest wrong?</AYA>
		<AYA id="004021">And how could ye take it when ye have gone in unto each other, and they have Taken from you a solemn covenant?</AYA>
		<AYA id="004022">And marry not women whom your fathers married,- except what is past: It was shameful and odious,- an abominable custom indeed.</AYA>
		<AYA id="004023">Prohibited to you (for marriage) are:- your mothers, daughters, sisters; father's sisters, mother's sisters; brother's daughters, sister's daughters; foster-mothers who gave you suck, foster-sisters; your wives' mothers; your step-daughters under your guardianship, born of your wives to whom ye have gone in,- no prohibition if ye have not gone in;- (those who have been) wives of your sons proceeding from your loins; and two sisters in wedlock at one and the same time, except for what is past; for Allah is Oft- forgiving, Most Merciful;-</AYA>
		<AYA id="004024">Also (prohibited are) women already married, except those whom your right hands possess: Thus hath Allah ordained (prohibitions) against you: Except for these, all others are lawful, provided ye seek (them in marriage) with gifts from your property,- desiring chastity, not fornication from them. Give them their dowers (at least) as prescribed; but if, after a dower is prescribed, agree Mutually (to vary it), there is no blame on you, and Allah is All-Knowing, All-wise.</AYA>
		<AYA id="004025">If any of you have not the means wherewith to wed free believing women, they may wed believing girls from among those whom your right hands possess: And Allah hath full knowledge about your faith. Ye are one from another: Wed them with the leave of their owners, and give them their dowers, according to what is reasonable: They should be chaste, not lustful, nor taking paramours: when they are taken in wedlock, if they fall into shame, their punishment is half that for free women. This (permission) is for those among you who fear sin; but it is better for you that ye practice self-restraint. And Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="004026">Allah doth wish to make clear to you and to show you the ordinances of those before you; and (He doth wish to) turn to you (In Mercy): And Allah is All-Knowing, All-wise.</AYA>
		<AYA id="004027">Allah doth wish to turn to you, but the wish of those who follow their lusts is that ye should turn away (from Him),- far, far away.</AYA>
		<AYA id="004028">Allah doth wish to lighten your (difficulties): For man was created weak (in resolution).</AYA>
		<AYA id="004029">O ye who believe! Eat not up your property among yourselves in vanities: But let there be amongst you traffic and trade by mutual good-will: Nor kill (or destroy) yourselves: for verily Allah hath been to you Most Merciful!</AYA>
		<AYA id="004030">If any do that in rancor and injustice,- soon shall We cast them into the Fire: And easy it is for Allah.</AYA>
		<AYA id="004031">If ye (but) eschew the most heinous of the things which ye are forbidden to do, We shall remit your evil deeds, and admit you to a Gate of great honor.</AYA>
		<AYA id="004032">And in no wise covet those things in which Allah Hath bestowed His gifts more freely on some of you than on others: to men is allotted what they earn, and to women what they earn: But ask Allah of His bounty. For Allah hath full knowledge of all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="004033">To (benefit) every one, We have appointed shares and heirs to property left by parents and relatives. To those, also, to whom your right hand was pledged, give their due portion. For truly Allah is witness to all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="004034">Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because Allah has given the one more (strength) than the other, and because they support them from their means. Therefore the righteous women are devoutly obedient, and guard in (the husband's) absence what Allah would have them guard. As to those women on whose part ye fear disloyalty and ill-conduct, admonish them (first), (next), refuse to share their beds, (and last) beat them (lightly); but if they return to obedience, seek not against them means (of annoyance): For Allah is Most High, Great (above you all).</AYA>
		<AYA id="004035">If ye fear a breach between them twain, appoint (two) arbiters, one from his family, and the other from hers; if they wish for peace, Allah will cause their reconciliation: For Allah hath full knowledge, and is acquainted with all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="004036">Serve Allah, and join not any partners with Him; and do good- to parents, kinsfolk, orphans, those in need, neighbors who are of kin, neighbors who are strangers, the companion by your side, the wayfarer (ye meet), and what your right hands possess: For Allah loveth not the arrogant, the vainglorious;-</AYA>
		<AYA id="004037">(Nor) those who are niggardly or enjoin niggardliness on others, or hide the bounties which Allah hath bestowed on them; for We have prepared, for those who resist Faith, a punishment that steeps them in contempt;-</AYA>
		<AYA id="004038">Not those who spend of their substance, to be seen of men, but have no faith in Allah and the Last Day: If any take the Satan for their intimate, what a dreadful intimate he is!</AYA>
		<AYA id="004039">And what burden were it on them if they had faith in Allah and in the Last Day, and they spent out of what Allah hath given them for sustenance? For Allah hath full knowledge of them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="004040">Allah is never unjust in the least degree: If there is any good (done), He doubleth it, and giveth from His own self a great reward.</AYA>
		<AYA id="004041">How then if We brought from each people a witness, and We brought thee as a witness against these people!</AYA>
		<AYA id="004042">On that day those who reject Faith and disobey the messenger will wish that the earth were made one with them: But never will they hide a single fact from Allah.</AYA>
		<AYA id="004043">O ye who believe! Approach not prayers with a mind befogged, until ye can understand all that ye say,- nor in a state of ceremonial impurity except when you are passing by (through the mosque), until after washing your whole body. If ye are ill, or on a journey, or one of you cometh from offices of nature, or ye have been in contact with women, and ye find no water, then take for yourselves clean sand (or earth), and rub therewith your faces and hands. For Allah doth blot out sins and forgive again and again.</AYA>
		<AYA id="004044">Hast thou not turned thy thought to those who were given a portion of the Book? they traffic in error, and wish that ye should lose the right path.</AYA>
		<AYA id="004045">But Allah hath full knowledge of your enemies: Allah is enough for a protector, and Allah is enough for a Helper.</AYA>
		<AYA id="004046">Of the Jews there are those who displace words from their (right) places, and say: "We hear and we disobey"; and "Hear, may you not hear"; and "Rn"; with a twist of their tongues and a slander to Faith. If only they had said: "We hear and we obey"; and "Do hear"; and "Do look at us"; it would have been better for them, and more proper; but Allah hath cursed them for their Unbelief; and but few of them will believe.</AYA>
		<AYA id="004047">O ye People of the Book! believe in what We have (now) revealed, confirming what was (already) with you, before We change the face and fame of some (of you) beyond all recognition, and turn them hindwards, or curse them as We cursed the Sabbath-breakers, for the decision of Allah must be carried out.</AYA>
		<AYA id="004048">Allah forgiveth not that partners should be set up with Him; but He forgiveth anything else, to whom He pleaseth; to set up partners with Allah is to devise a sin most heinous indeed.</AYA>
		<AYA id="004049">Hast thou not turned thy though to those who claim sanctity for themselves? Nay-but Allah doth sanctify whom He pleaseth. But never will they fail to receive justice in the least little thing.</AYA>
		<AYA id="004050">Behold! how they invent a lie against Allah. but that by itself is a manifest sin!</AYA>
		<AYA id="004051">Hast thou not turned thy vision to those who were given a portion of the Book? they believe in sorcery and Tagut (Evil), and say to the Unbelievers that they are better guided in the (right) way than the believers!</AYA>
		<AYA id="004052">They are (men) whom Allah hath cursed: And those whom Allah hath cursed, thou wilt find, have no one to help.</AYA>
		<AYA id="004053">Have they a share in dominion or power? Behold, they give not a farthing to their fellow-men?</AYA>
		<AYA id="004054">Or do they envy mankind for what Allah hath given them of his bounty? but We had already given the people of Abraham the Book and Wisdom, and conferred upon them a great kingdom.</AYA>
		<AYA id="004055">Some of them believed, and some of them averted their faces from him: And enough is Hell for a burning fire.</AYA>
		<AYA id="004056">Those who reject our Signs, We shall soon cast into the Fire: As often as their skins are roasted through, We shall change them for fresh skins, that they may taste the penalty: for Allah is Exalted in Power, Wise.</AYA>
		<AYA id="004057">But those who believe and do deeds of righteousness, We shall soon admit to Gardens, with rivers flowing beneath,- their eternal home: Therein shall they have spouses purified: We shall admit them to shades, cool and ever deepening.</AYA>
		<AYA id="004058">Allah doth command you to render back your trusts to those to whom they are due; And when ye judge between people, that ye judge with justice: Verily how excellent is the teaching which He giveth you! For Allah is He Who heareth and seeth all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="004059">O ye who believe! Obey Allah, and obey the Messenger, and those charged with authority among you. If ye differ in anything among yourselves, refer it to Allah and His Messenger, if ye do believe in Allah and the Last Day: That is best, and most suitable for final determination.</AYA>
		<AYA id="004060">Hast thou not turned thy though to those who declare that they believe in the revelations that have come to thee and to those before thee? Their (real) wish is to resort together for judgment (in their disputes) to the Tagut (Evil), though they were ordered to reject him. But Satan's wish is to lead them astray far away (from the right).</AYA>
		<AYA id="004061">When it is said to them: "Come to what Allah hath revealed, and to the Messenger.": Thou seest the hypocrites avert their faces from thee in disgust.</AYA>
		<AYA id="004062">How then, when they are seized by misfortune, because of the deeds which there hands have sent forth? Then they come to thee, swearing by Allah. "We meant no more than good-will and conciliation!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="004063">Those men,-Allah knows what is in their hearts; so keep clear of them, but admonish them, and speak to them a word to reach their very souls.</AYA>
		<AYA id="004064">We sent not a messenger, but to be obeyed, in accordance with the leave of Allah. If they had only, when they were unjust to themselves, come unto thee and asked Allah's forgiveness, and the Messenger had asked forgiveness for them, they would have found Allah indeed Oft-returning, Most Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="004065">But no, by thy Lord, they can have no (real) Faith, until they make thee judge in all disputes between them, and find in their souls no resistance against thy decisions, but accept them with the fullest conviction.</AYA>
		<AYA id="004066">If We had ordered them to sacrifice their lives or to leave their homes, very few of them would have done it: But if they had done what they were (actually) told, it would have been best for them, and would have gone farthest to strengthen their (faith);</AYA>
		<AYA id="004067">And We should then have given them from Ourselves a great reward;</AYA>
		<AYA id="004068">And We should have shown them the Straight Way.</AYA>
		<AYA id="004069">All who obey Allah and the messenger are in the company of those on whom is the Grace of Allah,- of the prophets (who teach), the Sincere (lovers of Truth), the martyrs, and the Righteous (who do good): Ah! How beautiful is there fellowship!</AYA>
		<AYA id="004070">Such is the bounty from Allah. And sufficient is it that Allah knoweth all.</AYA>
		<AYA id="004071">O ye who believe! Take your precautions, and either go forth in parties or go forth all together.</AYA>
		<AYA id="004072">There are certainly among you men who would tarry behind: If a misfortune befalls you, they say: "Allah did favor us in that we were not present among them."</AYA>
		<AYA id="004073">But if good fortune comes to you from Allah, they would be sure to say - as if there had never been ties of affection between you and them - "Oh! I wish I had been with them; a fine thing should I then have made of it!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="004074">Let those fight in the Cause of Allah who sell the life of this world for the hereafter. To him who fighteth in the cause of Allah,- whether he is slain or gets victory - soon shall We give him a reward of great (value).</AYA>
		<AYA id="004075">And why should ye not fight in the cause of Allah and of those who, being weak, are ill-treated (and oppressed)?- Men, women, and children, whose cry is: "Our Lord! Rescue us from this town, whose people are oppressors; and raise for us from Thee one who will protect; and raise for us from Thee one who will help!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="004076">Those who believe fight in the cause of Allah, and those who reject faith fight in the cause of Tagut (Evil): So fight ye against the friends of Satan: feeble indeed is the cunning of Satan.</AYA>
		<AYA id="004077">Hast thou not turned thy though to those who were told to hold back their hands (from fight) but establish regular prayers and spend in Zakat (regular charity)? When (at length) the order for fighting was issued to them, behold! a section of them feared men as - or even more than - they should have feared Allah. They said: "Our Lord! Why hast Thou ordered us to fight? Wouldst Thou not grant us respite to our (natural) term, near (enough)?" Say: "Short is the enjoyment of this world: the Hereafter is the best for those who do right: Never will ye be dealt with unjustly in the very least!</AYA>
		<AYA id="004078">"Wherever ye are, death will find you out, even if ye are in towers built up strong and high!" If some good befalls them, they say, "This is from Allah".; but if evil, they say, "This is from thee" (O Prophet). Say: "All things are from Allah." But what hath come to these people, that they fail to understand a single fact?</AYA>
		<AYA id="004079">Whatever good, (O man!) happens to thee, is from Allah. but whatever evil happens to thee, is from thy (own) soul. and We have sent thee as a messenger to (instruct) mankind. And enough is Allah for a witness.</AYA>
		<AYA id="004080">He who obeys the Messenger, obeys Allah. But if any turn away, We have not sent thee to watch over them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="004081">They have "Obedience" on their lips; but when they leave thee, a section of them meditate all night on things very different from what thou tellest them. But Allah records their nightly (plots): So keep clear of them, and put thy trust in Allah, and enough is Allah as a disposer of affairs.</AYA>
		<AYA id="004082">Do they not consider the Quran (with care)? Had it been from other than Allah, they would surely have found therein much discrepancy.</AYA>
		<AYA id="004083">When there comes to them some matter touching (public) safety or fear, they divulge it. If they had only referred it to the Messenger, or to those charged with authority among them, the proper investigators would have known it from them (direct). Were it not for the Grace and Mercy of Allah unto you, all but a few of you would have followed Satan.</AYA>
		<AYA id="004084">Then fight in Allah's Cause - Thou art held responsible only for thyself - and rouse the believers. It may be that Allah will restrain the fury of the Unbelievers; for Allah is the strongest in might and in punishment.</AYA>
		<AYA id="004085">Whoever interceded in a good cause becomes a partner therein: And whoever recommends and helps an evil cause, shares in its burden: And Allah hath power over all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="004086">When a (courteous) greeting is offered you, meet it with a greeting still more courteous, or (at least) of equal courtesy. Allah takes careful account of all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="004087">Allah. There is no god but He: of a surety He will gather you together against the Day of Judgment, about which there is no doubt. And whose word can be truer than Allah's?</AYA>
		<AYA id="004088">Why should ye be divided into two parties about the Hypocrites? Allah hath cost them of their (evil) deeds. Would ye guide those whom Allah hath thrown out of the Way? For those whom Allah hath thrown out of the Way, never shalt thou find the Way.</AYA>
		<AYA id="004089">They but wish that ye should reject Faith, as they do, and thus be on the same footing (as they): So take not friends from their ranks until they flee in the way of Allah (from what is forbidden). But if they turn renegades, seize them and slay them wherever ye find them; and (in any case) take no friends or helpers from their ranks;-</AYA>
		<AYA id="004090">Except those who join a group between whom and you there is a treaty (of peace), or those who approach you with hearts restraining them from fighting you or fighting their own people. If Allah had pleased, He could have given them power over you, and they would have fought you: Therefore if they withdraw from you but fight you not, and (instead) send you (guarantees of) peace, then Allah Hath opened no way for you (to war against them).</AYA>
		<AYA id="004091">Others you will find that wish to gain your confidence as well as that of their people: Every time they are sent back to temptation, they succumb thereto: if they withdraw not from you nor give you (guarantees) of peace besides restraining their hands, seize them and slay them wherever ye get them: In their case We have provided you with a clear argument against them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="004092">Never should a believer kill a believer, except by mistake. And whoever kills a believer by mistake, it is ordained that he should free a believing slave, and pay compensation to the deceased's family, unless they remit it freely. If the deceased belonged to a people at war with you, and he was a believer, the freeing of a believing slave (is enough). If he belonged to a people with whom ye have treaty of mutual alliance, compensation should be paid to his family, and a believing slave be freed. For those who find this beyond their means, (is prescribed) a fast for two months running: by way of repentance to Allah. for Allah hath All knowledge and All wisdom.</AYA>
		<AYA id="004093">If a man kills a believer intentionally, his recompense is Hell, to abide therein (for ever): And the wrath and the curse of Allah are upon him, and a dreadful penalty is prepared for him.</AYA>
		<AYA id="004094">O ye who believe! When ye go abroad in the cause of Allah, investigate carefully, and say not to any one who offers you a salutation: "Thou art none of a believer!" Coveting the perishable goods of this life: with Allah are profits and spoils abundant. Even thus were ye yourselves before, till Allah conferred on you His favors: Therefore carefully investigate. For Allah is well aware of all that ye do.</AYA>
		<AYA id="004095">Not equal are those believers who sit, except those who are disabled, and those who strive and fight in the cause of Allah with their goods and their persons. Allah hath granted a grade higher to those who strive and fight with their goods and persons than to those who sit (at home). Unto all (in faith) Hath Allah promised good: But those who strive and fight Hath He distinguished above those who sit (at home) by a great reward,-</AYA>
		<AYA id="004096">Ranks specially bestowed by Him, and Forgiveness and Mercy. For Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="004097">When angels take the souls of those who die in sin against their souls, they say: "In what (plight) were ye?" They reply: "Weak and oppressed were we in the earth." They say: "Was not the earth of Allah spacious enough for you to move yourselves away (from evil)?" Such men will find their abode in Hell,- What an evil refuge! -</AYA>
		<AYA id="004098">Except those who are (really) weak and oppressed - men, women, and children - who have no means in their power, nor can they find a way (to escape).</AYA>
		<AYA id="004099">For these, there is hope that Allah will forgive: For Allah doth blot out (sins) and forgive again and again.</AYA>
		<AYA id="004100">He who forsakes his home in the cause of Allah, finds in the earth many a refuge, wide and spacious: Should he die as a refugee from home for Allah and His Messenger, his reward becomes due and sure with Allah. And Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="004101">When ye travel through the earth, there is no blame on you if ye shorten your prayers, for fear the unbelievers may attack you: For the unbelievers are unto you open enemies.</AYA>
		<AYA id="004102">When thou (O Messenger) art with them, and standest to lead them in prayer, let one party of them stand up (in prayer) with thee, taking their arms with them: When they finish their prostrations, let them take their position in the rear, and let the other party come up which hath not yet prayed - and let them pray with thee, taking all precaution, and bearing arms: the unbelievers wish, if ye were negligent of your arms and your baggage, to assault you in a single rush. But there is no blame on you if ye put away your arms because of the inconvenience of rain or because ye are ill; but take (every) precaution for yourselves. For the unbelievers Allah hath prepared a humiliating punishment.</AYA>
		<AYA id="004103">When ye have performed the prayers, celebrate Allah's praises, standing, sitting down, or lying down on your sides; but when ye are free from danger, set up regular prayers: For such prayers are enjoined on believers at stated times.</AYA>
		<AYA id="004104">And slacken not in following up the enemy: If ye are suffering hardships, they are suffering similar hardships; but you have hope from Allah, while they have not. And Allah is full of knowledge and wisdom.</AYA>
		<AYA id="004105">We have sent down to thee the Book in truth, that thou mightest judge between people by that which Allah has shown thee; so be not an advocate by those who betray their trust;</AYA>

		<AYA id="004176">They ask thee for a legal decision. Say: Allah directs (thus) about those who leave no descendants or ascendants as heirs. If it is a man that dies, leaving a sister but no child, she shall have half the inheritance: If (such a deceased was) a woman, who left no child, her brother takes her inheritance: If there are two sisters, they shall have two-thirds of the inheritance (between them): if there are brothers and sisters, (they share), the male having twice the share of the female. Thus doth Allah make clear to you (His law), lest ye err. And Allah hath knowledge of all things.</AYA>

	<SOURA id="5" name="The Food">
		<AYA id="005001">O ye who believe! fulfill (all) obligations. Lawful unto you (for food) are all beasts of cattle, with the exceptions named: But animals of the chase are forbidden while ye are in the sacred precincts or in the state of pilgrimage: for Allah doth command according to His will and plan.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005002">O ye who believe! Violate not the sanctity of the symbols of Allah, nor of the Sacred Month, nor of the animals brought for sacrifice, nor the garlands that mark out such animals, nor the people resorting to the Sacred House, seeking of the bounty and good pleasure of their Lord. But when ye are clear of the sacred precincts and of pilgrim garb, ye may hunt, and let not the hatred of some people in (once) shutting you out of the Sacred Mosque lead you to transgression (and hostility on your part). Help ye one another in righteousness and piety, but help ye not one another in sin and rancor: fear Allah: for Allah is strict in punishment.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005003">Forbidden to you (for food) are: dead meat, blood, the flesh of swine, and that on which hath been invoked the name of other than Allah; that which hath been killed by strangling, or by a violent blow, or by a headlong fall, or by being gored to death; that which hath been (partly) eaten by a wild animal; unless ye are able to slaughter it (in due form); that which is sacrificed on stone (altars); (forbidden) also is the division (of meat) by raffling with arrows: that is impiety. This day have those who reject faith given up all hope of your religion: Yet fear them not but fear Me. This day have I perfected your religion for you, completed My favor upon you, and have chosen for you Islm as your religion. But if any is forced by hunger, with no inclination to transgression, Allah is indeed Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005004">They ask thee what is lawful to them (as food). Say: Lawful unto you are (all) things good and pure: and what ye have taught your trained hunting animals (to catch) in the manner directed to you by Allah: eat what they catch for you, but pronounce the name of Allah over it: and fear Allah; for Allah is swift in taking account.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005005">This day are (all) things good and pure made lawful unto you. The food of the People of the Book is lawful unto you and yours is lawful unto them. (Lawful unto you in marriage) are (not only) chaste women who are believers, but chaste women among the People of the Book, revealed before your time,- when ye give them their due dowers, and desire chastity, not lewdness, nor secret intrigues. If any one rejects faith, fruitless is his work, and in the Hereafter he will be in the ranks of those who have lost (all spiritual good).</AYA>
		<AYA id="005006">O ye who believe! when ye prepare for prayer, wash your faces, and your hands (and arms) to the elbows; Rub your heads (with water); and (wash) your feet to the ankles. If ye are in a state of ceremonial impurity, bathe your whole body. But if ye are ill, or on a journey, or one of you cometh from privy, or ye have been in contact with women, and ye find no water, then take for yourselves clean sand or earth, and rub therewith your faces and hands. Allah doth not wish to place you in a difficulty, but to make you clean, and to complete his favor to you, that ye may be grateful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005007">And call in remembrance the favor of Allah unto you, and His covenant, which He ratified with you, when ye said: "We hear and we obey": And fear Allah, for Allah knoweth well the secrets of your hearts.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005008">O ye who believe! stand out firmly for Allah, as witnesses to fair dealing, and let not the hatred of others to you make you swerve to wrong and depart from justice. Be just: that is next to piety: and fear Allah. For Allah is well-acquainted with all that ye do.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005009">To those who believe and do deeds of righteousness hath Allah promised forgiveness and a great reward.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005010">Those who reject faith and deny our signs will be companions of Hell-fire.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005011">O ye who believe! Call in remembrance the favor of Allah unto you when certain men formed the design to stretch out their hands against you, but (Allah) held back their hands from you: so fear Allah. And on Allah let believers put (all) their trust.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005012">Allah did aforetime take a covenant from the Children of Israel, and We appointed twelve chieftains among them. And Allah said: "I am with you: if ye (but) establish regular prayers, give Zakat (regular charity), believe in my messengers, honor and assist them, and loan to Allah a beautiful loan, verily I will wipe out from you your evils, and admit you to Gardens with rivers flowing beneath; but if any of you, after this, resisteth faith, he hath truly wandered from the path or rectitude."</AYA>
		<AYA id="005013">But because of their breach of their covenant, We cursed them, and made their hearts grow hard: they change the words from their (right) places and forget a good part of the message that was sent them, nor wilt thou cease to find them - barring a few - ever bent on (new) deceits: but forgive them, and overlook (their misdeeds): for Allah loveth those who are kind.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005014">From those, too, who call themselves Christians, We did take a covenant, but they forgot a good part of the message that was sent them: so We stirred up enmity and hatred between the one and the other, to the Day of Judgment. And soon will Allah show them what it is they have done.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005015">O people of the Book! There hath come to you our Messenger, revealing to you much that ye used to hide in the Book, and passing over much (that is now unnecessary): There hath come to you from Allah a (new) light and a perspicuous Book,-</AYA>
		<AYA id="005016">Wherewith Allah guideth all who seek His good pleasure to ways of peace and safety, and leadeth them out of darkness, by His will, unto the light,- guideth them to a Path that is straight.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005017">They disbelieved indeed those that say that Allah is Christ the son of Mary. Say: "Who then hath the least power against Allah, if His will were to destroy Christ the son of Mary, his mother, and every one that is on the earth? For to Allah belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth, and all that is between. He createth what He pleaseth. For Allah hath power over all things."</AYA>
		<AYA id="005018">(Both) the Jews and the Christians say: "We are sons of Allah, and his beloved." Say: "Why then doth He punish you for your sins? Nay, ye are but men,- of the men He hath created: He forgiveth whom He pleaseth, and He punisheth whom He pleaseth: and to Allah belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth, and all that is between: and unto Him is the final goal (of all)"</AYA>
		<AYA id="005019">O People of the Book! Now hath come unto you, making (things) clear unto you, Our Messenger, after the break in (the series of) our messengers, lest ye should say: "There came unto us no bringer of glad tidings and no warner (from evil)": But now hath come unto you a bringer of glad tidings and a warner (from evil). And Allah hath power over all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005020">Remember Moses said to his people: "O my people! Call in remembrance the favor of Allah unto you, when He produced prophets among you, made you kings, and gave you what He had not given to any other among the peoples.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005021">"O my people! Enter the holy land which Allah hath assigned unto you, and turn not back ignominiously, for then will ye be overthrown, to your own ruin."</AYA>
		<AYA id="005022">They said: "O Moses! In this land are a people of exceeding strength: Never shall we enter it until they leave it: if (once) they leave, then shall we enter."</AYA>
		<AYA id="005023">(But) among (their) God-fearing men were two on whom Allah had bestowed His grace: They said: "Assault them at the (proper) Gate: when once ye are in, victory will be yours; But on Allah put your trust if ye have faith."</AYA>
		<AYA id="005024">They said: "O Moses! while they remain there, never shall we be able to enter, to the end of time. Go thou, and thy Lord, and fight ye two, while we sit here (and watch)."</AYA>
		<AYA id="005025">He said: "O my Lord! I have power only over myself and my brother: so separate us from this rebellious people!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="005026">Allah said: "Therefore will the land be out of their reach for forty years: In distraction will they wander through the land: But sorrow thou not over these rebellious people.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005027">Recite to them the truth of the story of the two sons of Adam. Behold! they each presented a sacrifice (to Allah): It was accepted from one, but not from the other. Said the latter: "Be sure I will slay thee." "Surely," said the former, "Allah doth accept of the sacrifice of those who are righteous.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005028">"If thou dost stretch thy hand against me, to slay me, it is not for me to stretch my hand against thee to slay thee: for I do fear Allah, the Cherisher of the worlds.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005029">"For me, I intend to let thee draw on thyself my sin as well as thine, for thou wilt be among the companions of the fire, and that is the reward of those who do wrong."</AYA>
		<AYA id="005030">The (selfish) soul of the other led him to the murder of his brother: he murdered him, and became (himself) one of the lost ones.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005031">Then Allah sent a raven, who scratched the ground, to show him how to hide the shame of his brother. "Woe is me!" said he; "Was I not even able to be as this raven, and to hide the shame of my brother?" then he became full of regrets-</AYA>
		<AYA id="005032">On that account: We ordained for the Children of Israel that if any one slew a person - unless it be for murder or for spreading mischief in the land - it would be as if he slew the whole people: and if any one saved a life, it would be as if he saved the life of the whole people. Then although there came to them Our messengers with clear signs, yet, even after that, many of them continued to commit excesses in the land.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005033">The punishment of those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger, and strive with might and main for mischief through the land is: execution, or crucifixion, or the cutting off of hands and feet from opposite sides, or exile from the land: that is their disgrace in this world, and a heavy punishment is theirs in the Hereafter;</AYA>
		<AYA id="005034">Except for those who repent before they fall into your power: in that case, know that Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005035">O ye who believe! Do your duty to Allah, seek the means of approach unto Him, and strive (with might and main) in His cause: that ye may prosper.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005036">As to those who reject Faith,- if they had everything on earth, and twice repeated, to give as ransom for the penalty of the Day of Judgment, it would never be accepted of them, theirs would be a grievous penalty.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005037">Their wish will be to get out of the Fire, but never will they get out therefrom: their penalty will be one that endures.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005038">As to the thief, male or female, cut off his or her hands: a retribution for their deeds, and exemplary punishment from Allah, and Allah is Exalted in Power, Full of Wisdom.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005039">But if the thief repents after his crime, and amend his conduct, Allah turneth to him in forgiveness; for Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005040">Knowest thou not that to Allah (alone) belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth? He punisheth whom He pleaseth, and He forgiveth whom He pleaseth: and Allah hath power over all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005041">O Messenger! let not those grieve thee, who race each other into unbelief: (whether it be) among those who say "We believe" with their lips but whose hearts have no faith; or it be among the Jews,- men who will listen to any lie,- will listen even to others who have never so much as come to thee. They change the words from their (right) places: they say, "If ye are given this, take it, but if not, beware!" If any one's trial is intended by Allah, thou hast no authority in the least for him against Allah. For such - it is not Allah's will to purify their hearts. For them there is disgrace in this world, and in the Hereafter a heavy punishment.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005042">(They are fond of) listening to falsehood, of devouring anything forbidden. If they do come to thee, either judge between them, or decline to interfere. If thou decline, they cannot hurt thee in the least. If thou judge, judge in equity between them. For Allah loveth those who judge in equity.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005043">But why do they come to thee for decision, when they have (their own) Torah before them?- therein is the (plain) command of Allah; yet even after that, they would turn away. For they are not (really) People of Faith.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005044">It was We who revealed the Torah (to Moses): therein was guidance and light. By its standard have been judged the Jews, by the prophets who bowed (as in Islm) to Allah's will, by the rabbis and the doctors of law: for to them was entrusted the protection of Allah's book, and they were witnesses thereto: therefore fear not men, but fear Me, and sell not My signs for a miserable price. If any do fail to judge by (the light of) what Allah hath revealed, they are unbelievers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005045">We ordained therein for them: "Life for life, eye for eye, nose or nose, ear for ear, tooth for tooth, and wounds equal for equal." But if any one remits the retaliation by way of charity, it is an act of atonement for himself. And if any fail to judge by (the light of) what Allah hath revealed, they are wrong-doers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005046">And in their footsteps We sent Jesus the son of Mary, confirming the Torah that had come before him: We sent him the Gospel: therein was guidance and light, and confirmation of the Torah that had come before him: a guidance and an admonition to those who fear Allah.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005047">Let the people of the Gospel judge by what Allah hath revealed therein. If any do fail to judge by (the light of) what Allah hath revealed, they are (no better than) those who rebel.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005048">To thee We sent the Scripture in truth, confirming the scripture that came before it, and guarding it in safety: so judge between them by what Allah hath revealed, and follow not their vain desires, diverging from the Truth that hath come to thee. To each among you have we prescribed a Law and an Open Way. If Allah had so willed, He would have made you a single people, but (His plan is) to test you in what He hath given you: so strive as in a race in all virtues. The goal of you all is to Allah; it is He that will show you the truth of the matters in which ye dispute;</AYA>
		<AYA id="005049">And this (He commands): Judge thou between them by what Allah hath revealed, and follow not their vain desires, but beware of them lest they beguile thee from any of that (teaching) which Allah hath sent down to thee. And if they turn away, be assured that for some of their crime it is Allah's purpose to punish them. And truly most men are rebellious.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005050">Do they then seek after a judgment of (the days of) ignorance? But who, for a people whose faith is assured, can give better judgment than Allah.?</AYA>
		<AYA id="005051">O ye who believe! take not the Jews and the Christians for your friends and protectors: They are but friends and protectors to each other. And he amongst you that turns to them (for friendship) is of them. Verily Allah guideth not a people unjust.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005052">Those in whose hearts is a disease - thou seest how eagerly they run about amongst them, saying: "We do fear lest a change of fortune bring us disaster." Ah! perhaps Allah will give (thee) victory, or a decision according to His will. Then will they repent of the thoughts which they secretly harbored in their hearts.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005053">And those who believe will say: "Are these the men who swore their strongest oaths by Allah, that they were with you?" All that they do will be in vain, and they will fall into (nothing but) ruin.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005054">O ye who believe! if any from among you turn back from his Faith, soon will Allah produce a people whom He will love as they will love Him,- lowly with the believers, mighty against the rejecters, fighting in the way of Allah, and never afraid of the reproaches of such as find fault. That is the Grace of Allah, which He will bestow on whom He pleaseth. And Allah encompasseth all, and He knoweth all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005055">Your (real) friends are (no less than) Allah, His Messenger, and the (fellowship of) believers,- those who establish regular prayers and regular charity, and they bow down humbly (in worship).</AYA>
		<AYA id="005056">As to those who turn (for friendship) to Allah, His Messenger, and the (fellowship of) believers,- it is the party of Allah that must certainly triumph.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005057">O ye who believe! take not for friends and protectors those who take your religion for a mockery or sport,- whether among those who received the Scripture before you, or among those who reject Faith; but fear ye Allah, if ye have faith (indeed).</AYA>
		<AYA id="005058">When ye proclaim your call to prayer they take it (but) as mockery and sport; that is because they are a people without understanding.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005059">Say: "O people of the Book! Do ye disapprove of us for no other reason than that we believe in Allah, and the revelation that hath come to us and that which came before (us), and (perhaps) that most of you are rebellious and disobedient?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="005060">Say: "Shall I point out to you something much worse than this, (as judged) by the treatment it received from Allah? those who incurred the curse of Allah and His wrath, those of whom some He transformed into apes and swine, those who worshipped evil;- these are (many times) worse in rank, and far more astray from the even path!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="005061">When they come to thee, they say: "We believe": But in fact they enter with a mind against Faith, and they go out with the same but Allah knoweth fully all that they hide.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005062">Many of them dost thou see, racing each other in sin and transgression, and their eating of things forbidden. Evil indeed are the things that they do.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005063">Why do not the rabbis and the doctors of Law forbid them from their (habit of) uttering sinful words and eating things forbidden? Evil indeed are their works.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005064">The Jews say: "Allah's hand is tied up." Be their hands tied up and be they accursed for the (blasphemy) they utter. Nay, both His hands are widely outstretched: He giveth and spendeth (of His bounty) as He pleaseth. But the revelation that cometh to thee from Allah increaseth in most of them their obstinate rebellion and blasphemy. Amongst them we have placed enmity and hatred till the Day of Judgment. Every time they kindle the fire of war, Allah doth extinguish it; but they (ever) strive to do mischief on earth. And Allah loveth not those who do mischief.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005065">If only the People of the Book had believed and been righteous, We should indeed have blotted out their iniquities and admitted them to Gardens of Bliss.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005066">If only they had stood fast by the Torah, the Gospel, and all the revelation that was sent to them from their Lord, they would have (enjoyed) eating both from above them and from below their feet. There is from among them a party on the right course: but many of them follow a course that is evil.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005067">O Messenger! proclaim the (message) which hath been sent to thee from thy Lord. If thou didst not, thou wouldst not have fulfilled and proclaimed His mission. And Allah will defend thee from men (who mean mischief). For Allah guideth not those who reject Faith.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005068">Say: "O People of the Book! ye have no ground to stand upon unless ye stand fast by the Torah, the Gospel, and all the revelation that has come to you from your Lord." It is the revelation that cometh to thee from thy Lord, that increaseth in most of them their obstinate rebellion and blasphemy. But sorrow thou not over (these) people without Faith.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005069">Those who believe (in the Quran), those who follow the Jewish (scriptures), and the Sabians and the Christians,- any who believe in Allah and the Last Day, and work righteousness,- on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005070">We took the covenant of the Children of Israel and sent them messengers, every time, there came to them an a messenger with what they themselves desired not - some (of these) they called impostors, and some they (go so far as to) slay.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005071">They thought there would be no trial (or punishment); so they became blind and deaf; yet Allah (in mercy) turned to them; yet again many of them became blind and deaf. But Allah sees well all that they do.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005072">Certainly they disbelieve who say: "Allah is Christ the son of Mary." But said Christ: "O Children of Israel! worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord." Whoever joins other gods with Allah,- Allah will forbid him the Garden, and the Fire will be his abode. There will for the wrong-doers be no one to help.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005073">They disbelieved who say: Allah is one of three (in a Trinity): for there is no god except One God. If they desist not from their word (of blasphemy), verily a grievous chastisement will befall the disbelievers among them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005074">Why turn they not to Allah, and seek His forgiveness? For Allah is Oft- forgiving, Most Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005075">Christ the son of Mary was no more than a messenger; many were the messengers that passed away before him. His mother was a woman of truth. They had both to eat their (daily) food. See how Allah doth make His signs clear to them; yet see in what ways they are deluded away from the truth!</AYA>
		<AYA id="005076">Say: "Will ye worship, besides Allah, something which hath no power either to harm or benefit you? But Allah,- He it is that heareth and knoweth all things."</AYA>
		<AYA id="005077">Say: "O people of the Book! exceed not in your religion the bounds (of what is proper), trespassing beyond the truth, nor follow the vain desires of people who went wrong in times gone by,- who misled many, and strayed (themselves) from the even way.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005078">Curses were pronounced on those among the Children of Israel who rejected Faith, by the tongue of David and of Jesus the son of Mary: because they disobeyed and persisted in excesses.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005079">Nor did they forbid one another the iniquities which they committed: evil indeed were the deeds which they did.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005080">Thou seest many of them turning in friendship to the Unbelievers. Evil indeed are (the works) which their souls have sent forward before them (with the result), that Allah's wrath is on them, and in torment will they abide.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005081">If only they had believed in Allah, in the Prophet, and in what hath been revealed to him, never would they have taken them for friends and protectors, but most of them are rebellious wrong-doers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005082">Strongest among men in enmity to the believers wilt thou find the Jews and Pagans; and nearest among them in love to the believers wilt thou find those who say, "We are Christians": because amongst these are men devoted to learning and men who have renounced the world, and they are not arrogant.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005083">And when they listen to the revelation received by the Messenger, thou wilt see their eyes overflowing with tears, for they recognize the truth: they pray: "Our Lord! we believe; write us down among the witnesses.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005084">"What cause can we have not to believe in Allah and the truth which has come to us, seeing that we long for our Lord to admit us to the company of the righteous?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="005085">And for this their prayer hath Allah rewarded them with Gardens, with rivers flowing underneath,- their eternal home. Such is the recompense of those who do good.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005086">But those who reject Faith and belie Our Signs,- they shall be companions of Hell-fire.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005087">O ye who believe! make not unlawful the good things which Allah hath made lawful for you, but commit no excess: for Allah loveth not those given to excess.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005088">Eat of the things which Allah hath provided for you, lawful and good; but fear Allah, in Whom ye believe.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005089">Allah will not call you to account for what is void in your oaths, but He will call you to account for your deliberate oaths: for expiation, feed ten indigent persons, on a scale of the average for the food of your families; or clothe them; or give a slave his freedom. If that is beyond your means, fast for three days. That is the expiation for the oaths ye have sworn. But keep to your oaths. Thus doth Allah make clear to you His signs, that ye may be grateful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005090">O ye who believe! Intoxicants and gambling, (dedication of) stones, and (divination by) arrows, are an abomination,- of Satan's handwork: Eschew such (abomination), that ye may prosper.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005091">Satan's plan is (but) to excite enmity and hatred between you, with intoxicants and gambling, and hinder you from the remembrance of Allah, and from prayer: will ye not then abstain?</AYA>
		<AYA id="005092">Obey Allah, and obey the Messenger, and beware (of evil): if ye do turn back, know ye that it is Our Messenger's duty to proclaim (the message) in the clearest manner.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005093">On those who believe and do deeds of righteousness there is no blame for what they ate (in the past), when they guard themselves from evil, and believe, and do deeds of righteousness,- then again, guard themselves from evil and believe,- then again, guard themselves from evil and do good. For Allah loveth those who do good.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005094">O ye who believe! Allah doth but make a trial of you in a little matter of game well within reach of your hands and your lances, that He may test who feareth Him unseen: any who transgress thereafter, will have a grievous penalty.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005095">O ye who believe! Kill not game while in the sacred precincts or in state of pilgrimage. If any of you doth so intentionally, the compensation is an offering, brought to the Kba, of a domestic animal equivalent to the one he killed, as adjudged by two just men among you; or by way of atonement, the feeding of the indigent; or its equivalent in fasts: that he may taste of the penalty of his deed. Allah forgives what is past: for repetition Allah will punish him. For Allah is Exalted, and Lord of Retribution.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005096">Lawful to you is the pursuit of water-game and its use for food,- for the benefit of yourselves and those who travel; but forbidden is the pursuit of land-game;- as long as ye are in the sacred precincts or in state of pilgrimage. And fear Allah, to Whom ye shall be gathered back.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005097">Allah made the Kba, the Sacred House, an asylum of security for men, as also the Sacred Months, the animals for offerings, and the garlands that mark them: That ye may know that Allah hath knowledge of what is in the heavens and on earth and that Allah is well acquainted with all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005098">Know ye that Allah is strict in punishment and that Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005099">The Messenger's duty is but to proclaim (the message). But Allah knoweth all that ye reveal and ye conceal.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005100">Say: "Not equal are things that are bad and things that are good, even though the abundance of the bad may dazzle thee; so fear Allah, O ye that understand; that (so) ye may prosper."</AYA>
		<AYA id="005101">O ye who believe! Ask not questions about things which, if made plain to you, may cause you trouble. But if ye ask about things when the Quran is being revealed, they will be made plain to you, Allah will forgive those: for Allah is Oft- forgiving, Most Forbearing.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005102">Some people before you did ask such questions, and on that account lost their faith.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005103">It was not Allah who instituted (superstitions like those of) a slit-ear she- camel, or a she-camel let loose for free pasture, or idol sacrifices for twin-births in animals, or stallion-camels freed from work: It is the disbelievers who invent a lie against Allah. but most of them lack wisdom.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005104">When it is said to them: "Come to what Allah hath revealed; come to the Messenger.": They say: "Enough for us are the ways we found our fathers following." What! even though their fathers were void of knowledge and guidance?</AYA>
		<AYA id="005105">O ye who believe! Guard your own souls: If ye follow (right) guidance, no hurt can come to you from those who stray. the return of you all is to Allah; it is He that will inform you of all that ye do.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005106">O ye who believe! When death approaches any of you, (take) witnesses among yourselves when making bequests,- two just men of your own (brotherhood) or others from outside if ye are journeying through the earth, and the chance of death befalls you (thus). If ye doubt (their truth), detain them both after prayer, and let them both swear by Allah "We wish not in this for any worldly gain, even though the (beneficiary) be our near relation: We shall hide not the evidence before Allah. If we do, then behold! we shall be sinners!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="005107">But if it gets known that these two were guilty of the sin (of perjury), let two others stand forth in their places,- nearest in kin from among those who claim a lawful right: let them swear by Allah. "We affirm that our witness is truer than that of those two, and that we have not trespassed (beyond the truth): if we did, behold! we will be wrong-doers!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="005108">That is most suitable: that they may give the evidence in its true nature and shape, or else they would fear that other oaths would be taken after their oaths. But fear Allah, and listen (to His counsel): for Allah guideth not a rebellious people:</AYA>
		<AYA id="005109">On the day when Allah will gather the messengers together, and ask: "What was the response ye received (from men to your teaching)?" They will sa df2 y: "We have no knowledge: it is Thou Who knowest in full all that is hidden."</AYA>
		<AYA id="005110">Then will Allah say: "O Jesus the son of Mary! Recount My favor to thee and to thy mother. Behold! I strengthened thee with the Holy Spirit, so that thou didst speak to the people in childhood and in maturity. Behold! I taught thee the Book and Wisdom, the Torah and the Gospel. And behold! thou makest out of clay, as it were, the figure of a bird, by My leave, and thou breathest into it and it becometh a bird by My leave, and thou healest those born blind, and the lepers, by My leave. And behold! thou bringest forth the dead by My leave. And behold! I did restrain the Children of Israel from (violence to) thee when thou didst show them the Clear Signs, and the unbelievers among them said: 'This is nothing but evident magic.'</AYA>
		<AYA id="005111">"And behold! I inspired the Disciples to have faith in Me and Mine Messenger. They said, 'We have faith, and do thou bear witness that we bow to Allah as Muslims' ".</AYA>
		<AYA id="005112">Behold! the Disciples, said: "O Jesus the son of Mary! can thy Lord send down to us a Table set (with viands) from heaven?" Said Jesus: "Fear Allah, if ye have faith!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="005113">They said: "We only wish to eat thereof and satisfy our hearts, and to know that thou hast indeed told us the truth; and that we ourselves may be witnesses to the miracle."</AYA>
		<AYA id="005114">Said Jesus the son of Mary: "O Allah our Lord! Send us from heaven a Table set (with viands), that there may be for us - for the first and the last of us - a solemn festival and a sign from Thee; and provide for our sustenance, for Thou art the best Sustainer (of our needs)."</AYA>
		<AYA id="005115">Allah said: "I will send it down unto you: But if any of you after that resisteth faith, I will punish him with a penalty such as I have not inflicted on any one among all the peoples."</AYA>
		<AYA id="005116">And behold! Allah will say: "O Jesus the son of Mary! Didst thou say unto men, take me and my mother for two gods beside Allah.?" He will say: "Glory to Thee! never could I say what I had no right (to say). Had I said such a thing, Thou wouldst indeed have known it. Thou knowest what is in my heart, Thou I know not what is in Thine. For Thou knowest in full all that is hidden.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005117">"Never said I to them aught except what Thou didst command me to say, to wit, 'Worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord'; and I was a witness over them whilst I dwelt amongst them; when Thou didst take me up Thou wast the Watcher over them, and Thou art a witness to all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005118">"If Thou dost punish them, they are Thy servant: If Thou dost forgive them, Thou art the Exalted in power, the Wise."</AYA>
		<AYA id="005119">Allah will say: "This is a day on which the truthful will profit from their truth: theirs are Gardens, with rivers flowing beneath,- their eternal Home: Allah well-pleased with them, and they with Allah. That is the great salvation, (the fulfillment of all desires).</AYA>
		<AYA id="005120">To Allah doth belong the dominion of the heavens and the earth, and all that is therein, and it is He Who hath power over all things.</AYA>

		<AYA id="006046">Say: "Think ye, if Allah took away your hearing and your sight, and sealed up your hearts, who - a god other than Allah - could restore them to you?" See how We explain the signs by various (symbols); yet they turn aside.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006047">Say: "Think ye, if the punishment of Allah comes to you, whether suddenly or openly, will any be destroyed except those who do wrong?</AYA>
		<AYA id="006048">We send the messengers only to give good news and to warn: so those who believe and mend (their lives),- upon them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006049">But those who reject Our Signs,- them shall punishment touch, for that they ceased not from transgressing.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006050">Say: "I tell you not that with me are the Treasures of Allah, nor do I know what is hidden, nor do I tell you I am an angel. I but follow what is revealed to me." Say: "can the blind be held equal to the seeing?" Will ye then consider not?</AYA>
		<AYA id="006051">Give this warning to those in whose (hearts) is the fear that they will be brought (to judgment) before their Lord: except for Him they will have no protector nor intercessor: that they may guard (against evil).</AYA>
		<AYA id="006052">Send not away those who call on their Lord morning and evening, seeking His face. In naught art thou accountable for them, and in naught are they accountable for thee, that thou shouldst turn them away, and thus be (one) of the unjust.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006053">Thus did We test some of them by others, that they should say: "Is it these then that Allah hath favored from amongst us?" Doth not Allah know best those who are grateful?</AYA>
		<AYA id="006054">When those come to thee who believe in Our Signs, say: "Peace be on you: Your Lord hath inscribed for Himself (the rule of) Mercy: verily, if any of you did evil in ignorance, and thereafter repented, and amended (his conduct), lo! He is Oft- forgiving, Most Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006055">Thus do We explain the Signs in detail: that the way of the sinners may be shown up.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006056">Say: "I am forbidden to worship those - others than Allah - whom ye call upon." Say: "I will not follow your vain desires: If I did, I would stray from the path, and be not of the company of those who receive guidance."</AYA>
		<AYA id="006057">Say: "For me, I am on a clear Sign from my Lord, but ye reject Him. What ye would see hastened, is not in my power. The command rests with none but Allah: He declares the truth, and He is the best of judges."</AYA>
		<AYA id="006058">Say: "If what ye would see hastened were in my power, the matter would be settled at once between you and me. But Allah knoweth best those who do wrong."</AYA>
		<AYA id="006059">With Him are the keys of the Unseen, the treasures that none knoweth but He. He knoweth whatever there is on the earth and in the sea. Not a leaf doth fall but with His knowledge: there is not a grain in the darkness (or depths) of the earth, nor anything fresh or dry (green or withered), but is (inscribed) in a Record clear (to those who can read).</AYA>
		<AYA id="006060">It is He who doth take your souls by night, and hath knowledge of all that ye have done by day: by day doth He raise you up again; that a term appointed be fulfilled; In the end unto Him will be your return; then will He show you the truth of all that ye did.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006061">He is the Irresistibly Supreme over His servants, and He sets guardians over you. At length, when death approaches one of you, Our angels take his soul, and they never fail in their duty.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006062">Then they are returned unto Allah, their True Protector, surely His is the Command, and He is the swiftest in taking account.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006063">Say: "Who is it that delivereth you from the dark recesses of land and sea, when ye call upon Him in humility and in secret: 'If He only delivers us from these (dangers), (we vow) we shall truly show our gratitude'.?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="006064">Say: "It is Allah that delivereth you from these and all (other) distresses: and yet ye worship false gods!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="006065">Say: "He hath power to send calamities on you, from above and below, or to cover you with confusion in party strife, giving you a taste of mutual vengeance - each from the other." See how We explain the signs in diverse ways; that they may understand.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006066">But thy people reject this, though it is the Truth. Say: "Not mine is the responsibility for arranging your affairs;</AYA>
		<AYA id="006067">For every Prophecy is a limit of time, and soon shall ye know it."</AYA>
		<AYA id="006068">When thou seest men engaged in vain discourse about Our Signs, turn away from them unless they turn to a different theme. If Satan ever makes thee forget, then after recollection, sit not thou in the company of those who do wrong.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006069">On their account no responsibility falls on the righteous, but (their duty) is to remind them, that they may (learn to) fear Allah.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006070">Leave alone those who take their religion to be mere play and amusement, and are deceived by the life of this world. But continue to admonish with it (the Quran) lest a soul is caught in its own ruin by its own actions: it will find for itself no protector or intercessor except Allah: if it offered every ransom, (or reparation), none will be accepted: such is (the end of) those who deliver themselves to ruin by their own acts: they will have for drink (only) boiling water, and for punishment, one most grievous: for they persisted in rejecting Allah.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006071">Say: "Shall we call on others besides Allah,- things that can do us neither good nor harm,- and turn on our heels after receiving guidance from Allah? - like one whom the Satans have made into a fool, wandering bewildered through the earth, his friends calling: 'come to us', (vainly) guiding him to the path." Say: "Allah's guidance is the (only) guidance, and we have been directed to submit ourselves to the Lord of the worlds;-</AYA>
		<AYA id="006072">"To establish regular prayers and to fear Allah: for it is to Him that we shall be gathered together."</AYA>
		<AYA id="006073">It is He who created the heavens and the earth with true: the day He saith, "Be," behold! it is. His Word is the Truth. His will be the dominion the day the trumpet will be blown. He knoweth the Unseen as well as that which is Open. For He is the Wise, well acquainted (with all things).</AYA>
		<AYA id="006074">Lo! Abraham said to his father zar: "Takest thou idols for gods? For I see thee and thy people in manifest error."</AYA>
		<AYA id="006075">So also did We show Abraham the kingdom and the laws of the heavens and the earth, that he might (with understanding) have certitude.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006076">When the night covered him over, He saw a star: He said: "This is my Lord." But when it set, He said: "I love not those that set."</AYA>
		<AYA id="006077">When he saw the moon rising in splendor, he said: "This is my Lord." But when the moon set, He said: "Unless my Lord guide me, I shall surely be among those who go astray."</AYA>
		<AYA id="006078">When he saw the sun rising in splendor, he said: "This is my Lord; this is the greatest (of all)." But when the sun set, he said: "O my people! I am indeed free from your (guilt) of giving partners to Allah.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006079">"For me, I have set my face, firmly and truly, towards Him Who created the heavens and the earth, and never shall I give partners to Allah."</AYA>
		<AYA id="006080">His people disputed with him. He said: "(Come) ye to dispute with me, about Allah, when He (Himself) hath guided me? I fear not (the beings) ye associate with Allah. Unless my Lord willeth, (nothing can happen). My Lord comprehendeth in His knowledge all things. Will ye not (yourselves) be admonished?</AYA>
		<AYA id="006081">"How should I fear (the beings) ye associate with Allah, when ye fear not to give partners to Allah without any warrant having been given to you? Which of (us) two parties hath more right to security? (tell me) if ye know.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006082">"It is those who believe and mix not their beliefs with wrong - that are (truly) in security, for they are on (right) guidance."</AYA>
		<AYA id="006083">That was Our argument which We gave to Abraham (to use) against his people: We raise whom We will, degree after degree: for thy Lord is full of wisdom and knowledge.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006084">We gave him Isaac and Jacob: all (three) We guided: and before him, We guided Noah, and among his progeny, David, Solomon, Job, Joseph, Moses, and Aaron: thus do We reward those who do good:</AYA>
		<AYA id="006085">And Zakariya and John, and Jesus and Elias: all in the ranks of the Righteous:</AYA>
		<AYA id="006086">And Ismail and Elisha, and Jonah, and Lot: and to all We gave favor above the nations:</AYA>
		<AYA id="006087">(To them) and to their fathers, and progeny and brethren: We chose them, and we guided them to a straight Way.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006088">This is the Guidance of Allah. He giveth that guidance to whom He pleaseth, of His worshippers. If they were to join other gods with Him, all that they did would be vain for them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006089">These were the men to whom We gave the Book, and authority, and prophethood: if these (their descendants) reject them, Behold! We shall entrust their charge to a new People who reject them not.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006090">Those were the (prophets) who received Allah's guidance. Follow the guidance they received; Say: "No reward for this do I ask of you: This is but a reminder to the nations."</AYA>
		<AYA id="006091">No just estimate of Allah do they make when they say: "Nothing doth Allah send down to man (by way of revelation)" Say: "Who then sent down the Book which Moses brought?- a light and guidance to man: But ye make it into (separate) sheets for show, while ye conceal much (of its contents): therein were ye taught that which ye knew not - neither ye nor your fathers." Say: "Allah (sent it down)", then leave them to plunge in vain discourse and trifling.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006092">And this is a Book which We have sent down, bringing blessings, and confirming (the revelations) which came before it: that thou mayest warn the Mother of Cities (Makkah) and all around her. Those who believe in the Hereafter believe in this (Book), and they are constant in guarding their prayers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006093">Who can be more wicked than one who inventeth a lie against Allah, or saith, "I have received inspiration," when he hath received none, or (again) who saith, "I can reveal the like of what Allah hath revealed"? If thou couldst but see how the wicked (do fare) in the agonies of death! - the angels stretch forth their hands, (saying),"Yield up your souls: this day shall ye receive your reward,- a penalty of disgrace, for that ye used to tell lies against Allah, and scornfully to reject of His Signs!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="006094">"And behold! ye come to us bare and alone as We created you for the first time: Ye have left behind you all (the favors) which We bestowed on you: We see not with you your intercessors whom ye thought to be partners in your affairs: so now all relations between you have been cut off, and your (pet) fancies have left you in the lurch!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="006095">It is Allah Who causeth the seed-grain and the date-stone to split and sprout. He causeth the living to issue from the dead, and He is the One to cause the dead to issue from the living. That is Allah: then how are ye deluded away from the truth?</AYA>
		<AYA id="006096">He it is that cleaveth the day-break (from the dark): He makes the night for rest and tranquillity, and the sun and moon for the reckoning (of time): Such is the judgment and ordering of (Him), the Exalted in Power, the Omniscient.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006097">It is He Who maketh the stars (as beacons) for you, that ye may guide yourselves, with their help, through the dark spaces of land and sea: We detail Our Signs for people who know.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006098">It is He Who hath produced you from a single soul: then there is a nesting place and a repository: We detail Our Signs for people who understand.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006099">It is He Who sendeth down rain from the skies: with it We produce vegetation of all kinds: from some We produce green (crops), out of which We produce grain, heaped up (at harvest); out of the date-palm and its sheaths (or spathes) (come) clusters of dates hanging low and near: and (then there are) gardens of grapes, and olives, and pomegranates, each similar (in kind) yet different (in variety): when they begin to bear fruit, feast your eyes with the fruit and the ripeness thereof. Behold! in these things there are Signs for people who believe.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006100">Yet they make the Jinns equals with Allah, though Allah did create the Jinns; and they falsely, having no knowledge, attribute to Him sons and daughters. Praise and glory be to Him! (for He is) above what they attribute to Him!</AYA>
		<AYA id="006101">Wonderful Originator of the heavens and the earth: How can He have a son when He hath no consort? He created all things, and He hath full knowledge of all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006102">That is Allah, your Lord! there is no god but He, the Creator of all things: then worship ye Him: and He hath power to dispose of all affairs.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006103">No vision can grasp Him, but His grasp is over all vision: He is Subtle well-aware (of all things).</AYA>
		<AYA id="006104">"Now have come to you, from your Lord, proofs (to open your eyes): if any will see, it will be for (the good of) his own soul; if any will be blind, it will be to his own (harm): I am not (here) to watch over your doings."</AYA>
		<AYA id="006105">Thus do We explain the Signs by various (ways): that they may say, "Thou hast learnt this (from somebody)," and that We may make the matter clear to those who know.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006106">Follow what thou art taught by inspiration from thy Lord: there is no god but He: and turn aside from those who join gods with Allah.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006107">If it had been Allah's will, they would not have taken false gods: but We made thee not one to watch over their doings, nor art thou set over them to dispose of their affairs.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006108">Revile not ye those whom they call upon besides Allah, lest they out of spite revile Allah in their ignorance. Thus have We made alluring to each people its own doings. In the end will they return to their Lord, and He shall then tell them the truth of all that they did.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006109">They swear their strongest oaths by Allah, that if a (special) sign came to them, by it they would believe. Say: "Certainly (all) Signs are in the power of Allah: but what will make you (Muslims) realize that (even) if (special) signs came, they will not believe."?</AYA>
		<AYA id="006110">We (too) shall turn to (confusion) their hearts and their eyes, even as they refused to believe in this in the first instance: We shall leave them in their trespasses, to stumble blindly.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006111">Even if We did send unto them angels, and the dead did speak unto them, and We gathered together all things before their very eyes, they are not the ones to believe, unless it is in Allah's Plan. But most of them ignore (the truth).</AYA>
		<AYA id="006112">Likewise did We make for every Messenger an enemy,- evil ones among men and Jinns, inspiring each other with flowery discourses by way of deception. If thy Lord had so willed, they would not have done it: so leave them and what they forge.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006113">To such (deceit) let the hearts of those incline, who have no faith in the hereafter: let them delight in it, and let them earn from it what they may.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006114">Say: "Shall I seek for judge other than Allah? - when He it is Who hath sent unto you the Book, explained in detail." They know full well, to whom We have given the Book, that it hath been sent down from thy Lord in truth. Never be then of those who doubt.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006115">The Word of thy Lord doth find its fulfillment in truth and in justice: None can change His Words: for He is the One who heareth and knoweth all.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006116">Wert thou to follow the common run of those on earth, they will lead thee away from the way of Allah. They follow nothing but conjecture: they do nothing but lie.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006117">Thy Lord knoweth best who strayeth from His Way: He knoweth best those who are rightly guided.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006118">So eat of (meats) on which Allah's name hath been pronounced, if ye have faith in His Signs.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006119">Why should ye not eat of (meats) on which Allah's name hath been pronounced, when He hath explained to you in detail what is forbidden to you - except under compulsion of necessity? But many do mislead (men) by their low desires without knowledge. Thy Lord knoweth best those who transgress.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006120">Eschew all sin, open or secret: those who earn sin will get due recompense for their "earnings."</AYA>
		<AYA id="006121">Eat not of (meats) on which Allah's name hath not been pronounced: That would be impiety. But the evil ones ever inspire their friends to contend with you if ye were to obey them, ye would indeed be Pagans.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006122">Can he who was dead, to whom We gave life, and a Light whereby he can walk amongst men, be like him who is in the depths of darkness, from which he can never come out? Thus to those without faith their own deeds seem pleasing.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006123">Thus have We placed leaders in every town, its wicked men, to plot (and burrow) therein: but they only plot against their own souls, and they perceive it not.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006124">When there comes to them a Sign (from Allah), they say: "We shall not believe until we receive one (exactly) like those received by Allah's messengers." Allah knoweth best where (and how) to carry out His mission. Soon will the wicked be overtaken by humiliation before Allah, and a severe punishment, for all their plots.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006125">Those whom Allah willeth to guide,- He openeth their breast to Islm; those whom He willeth to leave straying,- He maketh their breast close and constricted, as if they had to climb up to the skies: thus doth Allah lay abomination on those who refuse to believe.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006126">This is the Way of thy Lord, leading straight: We have detailed the Signs for those who receive admonition.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006127">For them will be a Home of Peace with their Lord: He will be their Friend, because they practiced (righteousness).</AYA>
		<AYA id="006128">One day will He gather them all together, (and say): "O ye assembly of Jinns! Much (toll) did ye take of men." Their friends amongst men will say: "Our Lord! we made profit from each other: but (alas!) we reached our term - which thou didst appoint for us." He will say: "The Fire be your dwelling-place: you will dwell therein for ever, except as Allah willeth." for thy Lord is full of wisdom and knowledge.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006129">Thus do we make the wrong-doers turn to each other, because of what they earn.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006130">"O ye assembly of Jinns and men! came there not unto you messengers from amongst you, setting forth unto you My Signs, and warning you of the meeting of this Day of yours?" They will say: "We bear witness against ourselves." It was the life of this world that deceived them. So against themselves will they bear witness that they rejected Faith.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006131">(The messengers were sent) thus, for thy Lord would not destroy the towns unjustly whilst their occupants were unwarned.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006132">To all are degrees (or ranks) according to their deeds: for thy Lord is not unmindful of anything that they do.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006133">Thy Lord is Self-sufficient, full of Mercy: if it were His Will, He could destroy you, and in your place appoint whom He will as your successors, even as He raised you up from the posterity of other people.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006134">All that hath been promised unto you will come to pass: nor can ye frustrate it (in the least bit).</AYA>
		<AYA id="006135">Say: "O my people! Do whatever ye can: I will do (my part): soon will ye know who it is whose end will be (best) in the Hereafter: certain it is that the wrong- doers will not prosper."</AYA>
		<AYA id="006136">Out of what Allah hath produced in abundance in tilth and in cattle, they assigned Him a share: they say, according to their fancies: "This is for Allah, and this" - for our "partners"! but the share of their "partners" reacheth not Allah, whilst the share of Allah reacheth their "partners" ! Evil (and unjust) is their assignment!</AYA>
		<AYA id="006137">Even so, in the eyes of most of the pagans, their "partners" made alluring the slaughter of their children, in order to lead them to their own destruction, and cause confusion in their religion. If Allah had willed, they would not have done so: But leave alone them and what they forge.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006138">And they say that such and such cattle and crops are forbidden, and none should eat of them except those whom - so they say - We wish; further, there are cattle forbidden to yoke or burden, and cattle on which, (at slaughter), the name of Allah is not pronounced; - forging a lie against Allah's name: soon will He requite them for they forged.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006139">They say: "What is in the wombs of such and such cattle is specially reserved (for food) for our men, and forbidden to our women; but if it is still-born, then all have shares therein. For their (false) attribution (of superstitions to Allah), He will soon punish them: for He is full of wisdom and knowledge.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006140">Lost are those who slay their children, from folly, without knowledge, and forbid food which Allah hath provided for them, forging (lies) against Allah. They have indeed gone astray and heeded no guidance.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006141">It is He Who produceth gardens, with trellises and without, and dates, and tilth with produce of all kinds, and olives and pomegranates, similar (in kind) and different (in variety): eat of their fruit in their season, but render the dues that are proper on the day that the harvest is gathered. But waste not by excess: for Allah loveth not the wasters.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006142">Of the cattle are some for burden and some for meat: eat what Allah hath provided for you, and follow not the footsteps of Satan: for he is to you and avowed enemy.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006143">(Take) eight (head of cattle) in (four) pairs: of sheep a pair, and of goats a pair; say, hath He forbidden the two males, or the two females, or (the young) which the wombs of the two females enclose? Tell me with knowledge if ye are truthful:</AYA>
		<AYA id="006144">Of camels a pair, and of oxen a pair; say, hath He forbidden the two males, or the two females, or (the young) which the wombs of the two females enclose? - Were ye present when Allah ordered you such a thing? But who doth more wrong than one who invents a lie against Allah, to lead astray men without knowledge? For Allah guideth not people who do wrong.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006145">Say: "I find not in the Message received by me by inspiration any (meat) forbidden to be eaten by one who wishes to eat it, unless it be dead meat, or blood poured forth, or the flesh of swine,- for it is an abomination - or, what is impious, (meat) on which a name has been invoked, other than Allah's". But (even so), if a person is forced by necessity, without willful disobedience, nor transgressing due limits,- thy Lord is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006146">For those who followed the Jewish Law, We forbade every (animal) with undivided hoof, and We forbade them that fat of the ox and the sheep, except what adheres to their backs or their entrails, or is mixed up with a bone: this in recompense for their willful disobedience: for We are True (in Our ordinances).</AYA>
		<AYA id="006147">If they accuse thee of falsehood, say: "Your Lord is full of mercy all- embracing; but from people in guilt never will His wrath be turned back."</AYA>
		<AYA id="006148">Those who give partners (to Allah) will say: "If Allah had wished, we should not have given partners to Him nor would our fathers; nor should we have had any forbidden things." So did their ancestors argue falsely, until they tasted of Our wrath. Say: "Have ye any (certain) knowledge? If so, produce it before us. Ye follow nothing but conjecture: ye do nothing but lie."</AYA>
		<AYA id="006149">Say: "With Allah is the argument that reaches home: if it had been His Will, He could indeed have guided you all."</AYA>
		<AYA id="006150">Say: "Bring forward your witnesses to prove that Allah did forbid so and so." If they bring such witnesses, be not thou amongst them: Nor follow thou the vain desires of such as treat Our Signs as falsehoods, and such as believe not in the Hereafter: for they hold others as equal with their Guardian-Lord.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006151">Say: "Come, I will rehearse what Allah hath (really) prohibited you from": Join not anything with Him; be good to your parents; kill not your children on a plea of want;- We provide sustenance for you and for them;- come not nigh to indecent deed f9b s. Whether open or secret; take not life, which Allah hath made sacred, except by way of justice and law: thus doth He command you, that ye may learn wisdom.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006152">And come not nigh to the orphan's property, except to improve it, until he attain the age of full strength; give measure and weight with (full) justice;- no burden do We place on any soul, but that which it can bear;- whenever ye speak, speak justly, even if a near relative is concerned; and fulfill the Covenant of Allah. thus doth He command you, that ye may remember.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006153">Verily, this is My Way, leading straight: follow it: follow not (other) paths: they will scatter you about from His Path: thus doth He command you, that ye may be righteous.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006154">Moreover, We gave Moses the Book, completing (Our favor) to those who would do right, and explaining all things in detail,- and a guide and a mercy, that they might believe in the meeting with their Lord.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006155">And this is a Book which We have revealed as a blessing: so follow it and be righteous, that ye may receive mercy:</AYA>
		<AYA id="006156">Lest ye should say: "The Book was sent down to two Peoples before us, and for our part, we remained unacquainted with all that they learned by assiduous study:"</AYA>
		<AYA id="006157">Or lest ye should say: "If the Book had only been sent down to us, we should have followed its guidance better than they." Now then hath come unto you a Clear (Sign) from your Lord,- and a guide and a mercy: then who could do more wrong than one who rejecteth Allah's Signs, and turneth away therefrom? In good time shall We requite those who turn away from Our Signs, with a dreadful chastisement, for their turning away.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006158">Are they waiting to see if the angels come to them, or thy Lord (Himself), or certain of the Signs of thy Lord! the day that certain of the Signs of thy Lord do come, no good will it do to a soul to believe in them then if it believed not before nor earned righteousness through its faith. Say: "Wait ye: we too are waiting."</AYA>
		<AYA id="006159">As for those who divide their religion and break up into sects, thou hast no part in them in the least: their affair is with Allah. He will in the end tell them the truth of all that they did.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006160">He that doeth good shall have ten times as much to his credit: He that doeth evil shall only be recompensed according to his evil: no wrong shall be done unto them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006161">Say: "Verily, my Lord hath guided me to a Way that is straight,- a religion of right,- the Path (trod) by Abraham the true in Faith, and he (certainly) joined not gods with Allah."</AYA>
		<AYA id="006162">Say: "Truly, my prayer and my service of sacrifice, my life and my death, are (all) for Allah, the Cherisher of the Worlds:</AYA>
		<AYA id="006163">No partner hath He: this am I commanded, and I am the first of those who submit to His will.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006164">Say: "Shall I seek for (my) Lord other than Allah, when He is the Cherisher of all things (that exist)? Every soul draws the meed of its acts on none but itself: no bearer of burdens can bear of burdens can bear the burden of another. Your return in the end is towards Allah. He will tell you the truth of the things wherein ye disputed."</AYA>
		<AYA id="006165">It is He Who hath made you the inheritors of the earth: He hath raised you in ranks, some above others: that He may try you in the gifts He hath given you: for thy Lord is quick in punishment: yet He is indeed Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.</AYA>

	<SOURA id="7" name="The Elevated Place">
		<AYA id="007001">Alif, Lm, Mm, Sd.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007002">A Book revealed unto thee,- So let thy heart be oppressed no more by any difficulty on that account,- that with it thou mightest warn (the erring), and a reminder to the Believers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007003">Follow (O men!) the revelation given unto you from your Lord, and follow not, as friends or protectors, other than Him. Little it is ye remember of admonition.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007004">How many towns have We destroyed (for their sins)? Our punishment took them on a sudden by night or while they slept for their afternoon rest.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007005">When (thus) Our punishment took them, no cry did they utter but this: "Indeed we did wrong."</AYA>
		<AYA id="007006">Then shall we question those to whom Our Message was sent and those by whom We sent it.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007007">And verily, We shall recount their whole story with knowledge, for We were never absent (at any time or place).</AYA>
		<AYA id="007008">The balance that day will be true (to a nicety): those whose scale (of good) will be heavy, will prosper:</AYA>
		<AYA id="007009">Those whose scale will be light, will find their souls in perdition, for that they wrongfully treated Our Signs.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007010">It is We Who have placed you with authority on earth, and provided you therein with means for the fulfillment of your life: small are the thanks that ye give!</AYA>
		<AYA id="007011">It is We Who created you and gave you shape; then We bade the angels prostrate to Adam, and they prostrated; not so Iblis; He refused to be of those who bow down.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007012">(Allah) said: "What prevented thee from bowing down when I commanded thee?" He said: "I am better than he: Thou didst create me from fire, and him from clay."</AYA>
		<AYA id="007013">(Allah) said: "Get thee down from it (the Garden): it is not for thee to be arrogant here: get out, for thou art of the meanest (of creatures)."</AYA>
		<AYA id="007014">He said: "Give me respite till the day they are raised up."</AYA>
		<AYA id="007015">(Allah) said: "Be thou among those who have respite."</AYA>
		<AYA id="007016">He said: "Because thou hast thrown me out (of the Way), lo! I will lie in wait for them on Thy Straight Way:</AYA>
		<AYA id="007017">"Then will I assault them from before them and behind them, from their right and their left: Nor wilt Thou find, in most of them, gratitude (for Thy mercies)."</AYA>
		<AYA id="007018">(Allah) said: "Get out from this, disgraced and expelled. If any of them follow thee,- Hell will I fill with you all.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007019">"O Adam! dwell thou and thy wife in the Garden, and enjoy (its good things) as ye wish: but approach not this tree, lest you become of the unjust."</AYA>
		<AYA id="007020">Then began Satan to whisper suggestions to them, in order to reveal to them their shame that was hidden from them (before): he said: "Your Lord only forbade you this tree, lest ye should become angels or such beings as live for ever."</AYA>
		<AYA id="007021">And he swore to them both, that he was their sincere adviser.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007022">So by deceit he brought about their fall: when they tasted of the tree, their shame parts became manifest to them, and they began to sew together the leaves of the Garden over their bodies. And their Lord called unto them: "Did I not forbid you that tree, and tell you that Satan was an avowed enemy unto you?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="007023">They said: "Our Lord! We have wronged our own souls: If Thou forgive us not and bestow not upon us Thy Mercy, we shall certainly be lost."</AYA>
		<AYA id="007024">(Allah) said: "Get ye down. With enmity between yourselves. On earth will be your dwelling-place and your means of livelihood,- for a time."</AYA>
		<AYA id="007025">He said: "Therein shall ye live, and therein shall ye die; but from it shall ye be taken out (at last)."</AYA>
		<AYA id="007026">O ye Children of Adam! We have bestowed raiment upon you to cover your shame, as well as to be an adornment to you. But the raiment of righteousness,- that is the best. Such are among the Signs of Allah, that they may receive admonition!</AYA>
		<AYA id="007027">O ye Children of Adam! Let not Satan seduce you, in the same manner as he got your parents out of the Garden, stripping them of their raiment, to expose their shame: for he and his tribe watch you from a position where ye cannot see them: We made the Satans friends (only) to those without faith.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007028">When they commit ab Indecency, they say: "We found our fathers doing so"; and "Allah commanded us thus": Say: "Nay, Allah never command what is Indecent: do ye say of Allah what ye know not?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="007029">Say: "My Lord hath commanded justice; and that ye set your whole selves (to Him) at every time and place of prayer, and call upon Him, making your devotion sincere: such as He created you in the beginning, so shall ye return."</AYA>
		<AYA id="007030">Some He hath guided: Others have deserved the loss of their way; in that they took the Satans ones, in preference to Allah, for their friends and protectors, and think that they receive guidance.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007031">O Children of Adam! wear your beautiful apparel at every time and place of prayer: eat and drink: But waste not by excess, for Allah loveth not the wasters.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007032">Say: Who hath forbidden the beautiful (gifts) of Allah, which He hath produced for His servants, and the things, clean and pure, (which He hath provided) for sustenance? Say: They are, in the life of this world, for those who believe, (and) purely for them on the Day of Judgment. Thus do We explain the Signs in detail for those who know.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007033">Say: the things that my Lord hath indeed forbidden are: Indecent deeds, whether open or secret; sins and trespasses against truth or reason; assigning of partners to Allah, for which He hath given no authority; and saying things about Allah of which ye have no knowledge.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007034">To every People is a term appointed: when their term is reached, not an hour can they cause delay, nor (an hour) can they advance (it in anticipation).</AYA>
		<AYA id="007035">O ye Children of Adam! whenever there come to you messengers from amongst you, rehearsing My Signs unto you,- those who are righteous and mend (their lives),- on them shall be no fear nor shall they grieve.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007036">But those who reject Our Signs and treat them with arrogance,- they are companions of the Fire, to dwell therein (for ever).</AYA>
		<AYA id="007037">Who is more unjust than one who invents a lie against Allah or rejects His Signs? For such, their portion appointed must reach them from the Book (of Decrees): until, when Our messengers (of death) arrive and take their souls, they say: "Where are the things that ye used to invoke besides Allah." They will reply, "They have left us in the lurch," And they will bear witness against themselves, that they had rejected Allah.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007038">He will say: "Enter ye in the company of the Peoples who passed away before you - men and Jinns, - into the Fire." Every time a new People enters, it curses its sister-People (that went before), until they follow each other, all into the Fire. Saith the last about the first: "Our Lord! it is these that misled us: so give them a double punishment in the Fire." He will say: "Doubled for all" : but this ye do not know.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007039">Then the first will say to the last: "See then! No advantage have ye over us; so taste ye of the Chastisement for all that ye did !"</AYA>
		<AYA id="007040">To those who reject Our Signs and treat them with arrogance, no opening will there be of the gates of heaven, nor will they enter the Garden, until the camel can pass through the eye of the needle: Such is Our reward for those in sin.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007041">For them there is Hell, as a couch (below) and folds and folds of covering above: such is Our requital of those who do wrong.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007042">But those who believe and work righteousness,- no burden do We place on any soul, but that which it can bear,- they will be Companions of the Garden, therein to dwell (for ever).</AYA>
		<AYA id="007043">And We shall remove from their hearts any rancor;- beneath them will be rivers flowing;- and they shall say: "Praise be to Allah, who hath guided us to this (felicity): never could we have found guidance, had it not been for the guidance of Allah. indeed it was the truth, that the messengers of our Lord brought unto us." And they shall hear the cry: "Behold! the Garden before you! Ye have been made its inheritors, for your deeds (of righteousness)."</AYA>
		<AYA id="007044">The Companions of the Garden will call out to the Companions of the Fire: "We have indeed found the promises of our Lord to us true: Have you also found Your Lord's promises true?" They shall say, "Yes"; but a crier shall proclaim between them: "The Curse of Allah is on the wrong-doers;-</AYA>
		<AYA id="007045">"Those who would hinder (men) from the path of Allah and would seek in it something crooked: they were those who denied the Hereafter."</AYA>
		<AYA id="007046">Between them shall be a veil, and on the Heights will be men who would know every one by his marks: they will call out to the Companions of the Garden, "Peace on you": they have not entered it, but still hoped to (enter it).</AYA>
		<AYA id="007047">When their eyes shall be turned towards the Companions of the Fire, they will say: "Our Lord! send us not to the company of the wrong-doers."</AYA>
		<AYA id="007048">The men on the Heights will call to certain men whom they will know from their marks, saying: "Of what profit to you were your hoards and your arrogant ways?</AYA>
		<AYA id="007049">"Behold! are these not the men whom you swore that Allah with His Mercy would never bless? Enter ye the Garden: no fear shall be on you, nor shall ye grieve."</AYA>
		<AYA id="007050">The Companions of the Fire will call to the Companions of the Garden: "Pour down to us water or anything that Allah doth provide for your sustenance." They will say: "Both these things hath Allah forbidden to those who rejected Him."</AYA>
		<AYA id="007051">"Such as took their religion to be mere amusement and play, and were deceived by the life of the world." That day shall We forget them as they forgot the meeting of this day of theirs, and as they were wont to reject Our Signs.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007052">For We had certainly sent unto them a Book, based on knowledge, which We explained in detail,- a guide and a mercy to all who believe.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007053">Are they waiting for its fulfillment? On the day it is fulfilled, those who disregarded it before will say: "The messengers of our Lord did indeed bring true (tidings). Have we no intercessors now to intercede on our behalf? Or could we be sent back? then should we behave differently from our behavior in the past." In fact they will have lost their souls, and the things they forged will leave them in the lurch.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007054">Your Guardian Lord is Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth in six days, then He settled Himself on the Throne: He draweth the night as a veil o'er the day, each seeking the other in rapid succession: and the sun, the moon, and the stars, (all) are subservient by His Command. Verily, His are the Creation and the Command. Blessed be Allah, the Cherisher and Sustainer of the Worlds!</AYA>
		<AYA id="007055">Call on your Lord with humility and in private: for Allah loveth not those who trespass beyond bounds.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007056">Do no mischief on the earth, after it hath been set in order, but call on Him with fear and longing (in your hearts): for the Mercy of Allah is (always) near to those who do good.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007057">It is He Who sendeth the winds like heralds of glad tidings, going before His mercy: when they have carried the heavy-laden clouds, We drive them to a land that is dead, make rain to descend thereon, and produce every kind of harvest therewith: thus shall We raise up the dead: perchance ye may remember.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007058">From the land that is clean and good, by the Will of its Cherisher, springs up produce, (rich) after its kind: but from the land that is bad, springs up nothing but that which is scanty. Thus do we explain the Signs by various (symbols) to those who are grateful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007059">We sent Noah to his people. He said: "O my people! worship Allah! ye have no other god but Him. I fear for you the Punishment of a dreadful Day!</AYA>
		<AYA id="007060">The leaders of his people said: "Ah! we see thee in evident error."</AYA>
		<AYA id="007061">He said: "O my people! No wandering is there in my (mind): on the contrary I am a messenger from the Lord and Cherisher of the Worlds!</AYA>
		<AYA id="007062">"I but convey to you the Message of my Lord: Sincere is my advice to you, and I know from Allah something that ye know not.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007063">"Do ye wonder that there hath come to you a remainder from your Lord, through a man of your own people, to warn you,- so that ye may fear Allah and haply receive His Mercy?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="007064">But they rejected him, and We delivered him, and those with him, in the Ark: but We overwhelmed in the Flood those who rejected Our Signs. They were indeed a blind people!</AYA>
		<AYA id="007065">To the d people, (We sent) Hd, one of their (own) brethren: He said: "O my people! Worship Allah: ye have no other god but Him. Will ye not fear (Allah)?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="007066">The leaders of the unbelievers among his people said: "Ah! we see thou art a folly!", and "We think thou art a liar!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="007067">He said: "O my people! there is no folly in me, but (I am) a messenger from the Lord and Cherisher of the Worlds!</AYA>
		<AYA id="007068">"I but convey to you the Message of my Lord: I am to you a sincere and trustworthy adviser."</AYA>
		<AYA id="007069">"Do ye wonder that there hath come to you a message from your Lord through a man of your own people, to warn you? Call in remembrance that He made you inheritors after the people of Noah, and gave you a stature tall among the nations. Call in remembrance the benefits (ye have received) from Allah. that so ye may prosper."</AYA>
		<AYA id="007070">They said: "Comest thou to us, that we may worship Allah alone, and give up that which our fathers used to worship? bring us what thou threatenest us with, if so be that thou tellest the truth!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="007071">He said: "Punishment and wrath have already come upon you from your Lord: dispute ye with me over names which ye have devised - ye and your fathers,- without authority from Allah? Then wait: I am amongst you, also waiting."</AYA>
		<AYA id="007072">We saved him and those who adhered to him, by Our Mercy, and We cut off the roots of those who rejected Our Signs and did not believe.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007073">To the Thamd people (We sent) Slih, one of their own brethren: He said: "O my people! worship Allah. ye have no other god but Him. Now hath come unto you a clear (Sign) from your Lord! This she-camel of Allah is a Sign unto you: So leave her to graze in Allah's earth, and let her come to no harm, or ye shall be seized with a grievous punishment.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007074">"And remember how He made you inheritors after the d people and gave you habitations in the land: ye build for yourselves palaces and castles in (open) plains, and carve out homes in the mountains; so bring to remembrance the benefits (ye have received) from Allah, and refrain from evil and mischief on the earth."</AYA>
		<AYA id="007075">The leaders of the arrogant party among his people said to those who were reckoned powerless - those among them who believed: "Know ye indeed that Slih is a messenger from his Lord?" They said: "We do indeed believe in the revelation which hath been sent through him."</AYA>
		<AYA id="007076">The Arrogant party said: "For our part, we reject what ye believe in."</AYA>
		<AYA id="007077">Then they ham-strung the she-camel, and insolently defied the order of their Lord, saying: "O Slih! bring about thy threats, if thou art a messenger (of Allah)!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="007078">So the earthquake took them unawares, and they lay prostrate in their homes in the morning!</AYA>
		<AYA id="007079">So Slih left them, saying: "O my people! I did indeed convey to you the message for which I was sent by my Lord: I gave you good counsel, but ye love not good counselors!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="007080">We also (sent) Lt: He said to his people: "Do ye commit lewdness such as no people in creation (ever) committed before you?</AYA>
		<AYA id="007081">"For ye practice your lusts on men in preference to women : ye are indeed a people transgressing beyond bounds."</AYA>
		<AYA id="007082">And his people gave no answer but this: they said, "Drive them out of your city: these are indeed men who want to be clean and pure!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="007083">But we saved him and his family, except his wife: she was of those who legged behind.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007084">And we rained down on them a shower (of brimstone): Then see what was the end of those who indulged in sin and crime!</AYA>
		<AYA id="007085">To the Madyan people We sent Shuib, one of their own brethren: he said: "O my people! worship Allah. Ye have no other god but Him. Now hath come unto you a clear (Sign) from your Lord! Give just measure and weight, nor withhold from the people the things that are their due; and do no mischief on the earth after it has been set in order: that will be best for you, if ye have Faith.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007086">"And squat not on every road, breathing threats, hindering from the path of Allah those who believe in Him, and seeking in it something crooked; But remember how ye were little, and He gave you increase. And see what was the end of those who did mischief.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007087">"And if there is a party among you who believes in the Message with which I have been sent, and a party which does not believe, hold yourselves in patience until Allah doth decide between us: for He is the best to decide."</AYA>
		<AYA id="007088">The leaders, the arrogant party among his people, said: "O Shuib! we shall certainly drive thee out of our city - (thee) and those who believe with thee; or else ye (thou and they) shall have to return to our religion." He said: "What! even though we do detest (them)?</AYA>
		<AYA id="007089">"We should indeed forge a lie against Allah, if we returned to your religion after Allah hath rescued us therefrom; nor could we by any manner of means return thereto unless it be as in the will of Allah, Our Lord. Our Lord comprehend all things in His knowledge. In Allah is our trust. Our Lord! decide Thou between us and our people in truth, for Thou art the best to decide."</AYA>
		<AYA id="007090">The leaders, the unbelievers among his people, said: "If ye follow Shuib, be sure then ye are ruined!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="007091">But the earthquake took them unawares, and they lay prostrate in their homes before the morning!</AYA>
		<AYA id="007092">The men who reject Shuib became as if they had never been in the homes where they had flourished: the men who rejected Shuib - it was they who were ruined!</AYA>
		<AYA id="007093">So Shuib left them, saying: "O my people! I did indeed convey to you the Messages for which I was sent by my Lord: I gave you good counsel, but how shall I lament over a people who refuse to believe!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="007094">Whenever We sent a prophet to a town, We took up its people in suffering and adversity, in order that they might call in humility.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007095">Then We changed their suffering into prosperity, until they grew and multiplied, and began to say: "Our fathers (too) were touched by suffering and affluence" ... Behold! We called them to account of a sudden, while they realized not (their peril).</AYA>
		<AYA id="007096">If the people of the towns had but believed and feared Allah, We should indeed have opened out to them (All kinds of) blessings from heaven and earth; but they rejected (the truth), and We brought them to book for their misdeeds.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007097">Did the people of the towns feel secure against the coming of Our wrath by night while they were asleep?</AYA>
		<AYA id="007098">Or else did they feel secure against its coming in broad daylight while they played about (care-free)?</AYA>
		<AYA id="007099">Did they then feel secure against Allah's devising - but no one can feel secure from the Plan of Allah, except those (doomed) to ruin!</AYA>
		<AYA id="007100">To those who inherit the earth in succession to its (previous) possessors, is it not a guiding, (lesson) that, if We so willed, We could punish them (too) for their sins, and seal up their hearts so that they could not hear?</AYA>
		<AYA id="007101">Such were the towns whose story We (thus) relate unto thee: There came indeed to them their messengers with clear (Signs): But they would not believe what they had rejected before. Thus doth Allah seal up the hearts of those who reject faith.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007102">Most of them We found not men (true) to their covenant: but most of them We found rebellious and disobedient.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007103">Then after them We sent Moses with Our Signs to Pharaoh and his chiefs, but they wrongfully rejected them: So see what was the end of those who made mischief.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007104">Moses said: "O Pharaoh! I am a messenger from the Lord of the Worlds,-</AYA>
		<AYA id="007105">One for whom it is right to say nothing but truth about Allah. Now have I come unto you (people), from your Lord, with a clear (Sign): So let the Children of Israel depart along with me."</AYA>
		<AYA id="007106">(Pharaoh) said: "If indeed thou hast come with a Sign, show it forth,- if thou tellest the truth."</AYA>
		<AYA id="007107">Then (Moses) threw his rod, and behold! it was a serpent, plain (for all to see)!</AYA>
		<AYA id="007108">And he drew out his hand, and behold! it was white to all beholders!</AYA>
		<AYA id="007109">Said the Chiefs of the people of Pharaoh: "This is indeed a sorcerer well- versed.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007110">"His plan is to get you out of your land: then what is it ye counsel?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="007111">They said: "Keep him and his brother in suspense (for a while); and send to the cities men to collect-</AYA>
		<AYA id="007112">"And bring up to thee all (our) sorcerers well-versed."</AYA>
		<AYA id="007113">So there came the sorcerers to Pharaoh: They said, "of course we shall have a (suitable) reward if we win!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="007114">He said: "Yea, (and more),- for ye shall in that case be (raised to posts) nearest (to my person)."</AYA>
		<AYA id="007115">They said: "O Moses! wilt thou throw (first), or shall we have the (first) throw?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="007116">Said Moses: "Throw ye (first)." So when they threw, they bewitched the eyes of the people, and struck terror into them: for they showed a great (feat of) magic.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007117">We revealed to Moses: "Throw (now) thy rod" :and behold! it swallows up all the falsehoods which they fake!</AYA>
		<AYA id="007118">Thus truth was confirmed, and all that they did was made of no effect.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007119">So they were vanquished there and then, and turned about humiliated.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007120">But the sorcerers fell down prostrate in adoration.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007121">Saying: "We believe in the Lord of the Worlds,-</AYA>
		<AYA id="007122">"The Lord of Moses and Aaron."</AYA>
		<AYA id="007123">Said Pharaoh: "Believe ye in Him before I give you permission? Surely this is a trick which ye have planned in the city to drive out its people: but soon shall ye know (the consequences).</AYA>
		<AYA id="007124">"Be sure I will cut off your hands and your feet on apposite sides, and I will crucify you all."</AYA>
		<AYA id="007125">They said: "For us, We are but sent back unto our Lord:</AYA>
		<AYA id="007126">"But thou dost wreak thy vengeance on us simply because we believed in the Signs of our Lord when they reached us! Our Lord! pour out on us patience and constancy, and take our souls unto Thee as Muslims (who bow to Thy Will)!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="007127">Said the chiefs of Pharaoh's people: "Wilt thou leave Moses and his people, to spread mischief in the land, and to abandon thee and thy gods?" He said: "Their male children will we slay; (only) their females will we save alive; and we have over them (power) irresistible."</AYA>
		<AYA id="007128">Said Moses to his people: "Pray for help from Allah, and (wait) in patience and constancy: for the earth is Allah's, to give as a heritage to such of His servants as He pleaseth; and the end is (best) for the righteous."</AYA>
		<AYA id="007129">They said: "We have had (nothing but) trouble, both before and after thou camest to us." He said: "It may be that your Lord will destroy your enemy and make you inheritors in the earth; that so He may see how you act."</AYA>
		<AYA id="007130">We punished the people of Pharaoh with years (of droughts) and shortness of crops; that they might receive admonition.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007131">But when good (times) came, they said, "This is due to us;" When gripped by calamity, they ascribed it to evil omens connected with Moses and those with him! Behold! in truth the omens of evil are theirs in Allah's sight, but most of them do not understand!</AYA>
		<AYA id="007132">They said (to Moses): "Whatever be the Signs thou bringest, to work therewith thy sorcery on us, we shall never believe in thee."</AYA>
		<AYA id="007133">So We sent on them: Wholesale Death, Locusts, Lice, Frogs, And Blood: Signs openly self-explained: but they were steeped in arrogance,- a people given to sin.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007134">And when the plague fell on them, they said: "O Moses! on our behalf call on thy Lord in virtue of his promise to thee: If thou wilt remove the Plague from us, we shall truly believe in thee, and we shall send away the Children of Israel with thee."</AYA>
		<AYA id="007135">But every time We removed the Plague from them according to a fixed term which they had to fulfill,- Behold! they broke their word!</AYA>
		<AYA id="007136">So We exacted retribution from them: We drowned them in the sea, because they rejected Our Signs and failed to take warning from them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007137">And We made a people, considered weak (and of no account), inheritors of lands in both East and West, - lands whereon We sent down Our blessings. The fair promise of thy Lord was fulfilled for the Children of Israel, because they had patience and constancy, and We leveled to the ground the great works and fine buildings which Pharaoh and his people erected (with such pride).</AYA>
		<AYA id="007138">We took the Children of Israel (with safety) across the sea. They came upon a people devoted entirely to some idols they had. They said: "O Moses! fashion for us a god like unto the gods they have." He said: "Surely ye are a people without knowledge.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007139">"As to these folk,- the cult they are in is bound to destruction, and vain is the (worship) which they practice."</AYA>
		<AYA id="007140">He said: "Shall I seek for you a god other than Allah, when it is Allah Who hath endowed you with gifts above the nations?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="007141">And remember We rescued you from Pharaoh's people, who afflicted you with the worst of punishments, who slew your male children and saved alive your females: in that was a momentous trial from your Lord.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007142">We appointed for Moses thirty nights, and completed (the period) with ten (more): thus was completed the term with his Lord, forty nights. And Moses had charged his brother Aaron (before he went up): "Act for me amongst my people: Do right, and follow not the way of those who do mischief."</AYA>
		<AYA id="007143">When Moses came to the place appointed by Us, and his Lord addressed him, He said: "O my Lord! show (Thyself) to me, that I may look upon Thee." Allah said: "By no means canst thou see Me (direct); But look upon the mount; if it abide in its place, then shalt thou see Me." When his Lord manifested Himself to the Mount, He made it as dust. And Moses fell down in a swoon. When he recovered his senses he said: "Glory be to Thee! to Thee I turn in repentance, and I am the first to believe."</AYA>
		<AYA id="007144">(Allah) said: "O Moses! I have chosen thee above (other) men, by the messages I (have given thee) and the words I (have spoken to thee): take then the (revelation) which I give thee, and be of those who give thanks."</AYA>
		<AYA id="007145">And We ordained for him in the Tablets in all matters, admonition and explanation of all things, (and said): "Take and hold these with firmness, and enjoin thy people to hold fast by the best in the precepts: soon shall I show you the homes of the wicked,- (how they lie desolate)."</AYA>
		<AYA id="007146">Those who behave arrogantly on the earth in defiance of right - them will I turn away from My Signs: Even if they see all the Signs, they will not believe in them; and if they see the way of right conduct, they will not adopt it as the way; but if they see the way of error, that is the way they will adopt. For they have rejected Our Signs, and failed to take warning from them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007147">Those who reject Our Signs and the meeting in the Hereafter,- vain are their deeds: Can they expect to be rewarded except as they have wrought?</AYA>
		<AYA id="007148">The people of Moses made, in his absence, out of their ornaments, the body of a calf, (for worship): having lowing sound: did they not see that it could neither speak to them, nor show them the Way? They took it for worship and they did wrong.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007149">When they repented, and saw that they had erred, they said: "If our Lord have not mercy upon us and forgive us, we shall indeed be among the losers."</AYA>
		<AYA id="007150">When Moses came back to his people, angry and grieved, he said: "Evil it is that ye have done in my place in my absence: did ye make haste to bring on the judgment of your Lord?" He put down the Tablets, seized his brother by (the hair of) his head, and dragged him to him. Aaron said: "Son of my mother! the people did indeed reckon me as naught, and went near to slaying me! Make not the enemies rejoice over my misfortune, nor count thou me amongst the people of sin."</AYA>
		<AYA id="007151">Moses prayed: "O my Lord! forgive me and my brother! admit us to Thy mercy! for Thou art the Most Merciful of those who show mercy!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="007152">Those who took the calf (for worship) will indeed be overwhelmed with wrath from their Lord, and with shame in this life: thus do We recompense those who invent (falsehoods).</AYA>
		<AYA id="007153">But those who do wrong but repent thereafter and (truly) believe,- verily thy Lord is thereafter Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007154">When the anger of Moses was appeased, he took up the Tablets: in the writing thereon was Guidance and Mercy for such as fear their Lord.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007155">And Moses chose seventy of his people for Our place of meeting: when they were seized with violent quaking, he prayed: "O my Lord! if it had been Thy will Thou couldst have destroyed, long before, both them and me: wouldst Thou destroy us for the deeds of the foolish ones among us? this is no more than Thy trial: by it Thou causest whom Thou wilt stray, and Thou leadest whom Thou wilt into the right path. Thou art our Protector: so forgive us and give us Thy mercy; for Thou art the Best of those who forgive.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007156">"And ordain for us that which is good, in this life and in the Hereafter: for we have turned unto Thee." He said: "I afflict on whom I will; but My mercy extendeth to all things. That (mercy) I shall ordain for those who do right, and pay Zakat, and those who believe in Our signs;-</AYA>
		<AYA id="007157">"Those who follow the messenger, the unlettered Prophet, whom they find mentioned in their own (scriptures),- in the Law and the Gospel;- for he commands them what is just and forbids them what is evil; he allows them as lawful what is good (and pure) and prohibits them from what is bad (and impure); He releases them from their heavy burdens and from the yokes that are upon them. So it is those who believe in him, honor him, help him, and follow the Light which is sent down with him,- it is they who will prosper."</AYA>
		<AYA id="007158">Say: "O men! I am sent unto you all, as the Messenger of Allah, to Whom belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth: there is no god but He: it is He that giveth both life and death. So believe in Allah and His Messenger, the Unlettered Prophet, who believeth in Allah and His Words: follow him that (so) ye may be guided."</AYA>
		<AYA id="007159">Of the people of Moses there is a section who guide and do justice in the light of truth.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007160">We divided them into twelve tribes or nations. We directed Moses by inspiration, when his (thirsty) people asked him for water: "Strike the rock with thy staff": out of it there gushed forth twelve springs: Each group knew its own place for water. We gave them the shade of clouds, and sent down to them manna and quails, (saying): "Eat of the good things We have provided for you": (but they rebelled); to Us they did no harm, but they harmed their own souls.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007161">And remember it was said to them: "Dwell in this town and eat therein as ye wish, but say the word of humility and enter the gate in a posture of humility: We shall forgive you your faults; We shall increase (the portion of) those who do good."</AYA>
		<AYA id="007162">But the transgressors among them changed the word from that which had been given them so we sent on them a plague from heaven. For that they repeatedly transgressed.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007163">Ask them concerning the town standing close by the sea. Behold! they transgressed in the matter of the Sabbath. For on the day of their Sabbath their fish did come to them, openly holding up their heads, but on the day they had no Sabbath, they came not: thus did We make a trial of them, for they were given to transgression.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007164">When some of them said: "Why do ye preach to a people whom Allah will destroy or visit with a terrible punishment?"- said the preachers:" To discharge our duty to your Lord, and perchance they may fear Him."</AYA>
		<AYA id="007165">When they disregarded the warnings that had been given them, We rescued those who forbade Evil; but We visited the wrong-doers with a grievous punishment because they were given to transgression.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007166">When in their insolence they transgressed (all) prohibitions, We said to them: "Be ye apes, despised and rejected."</AYA>
		<AYA id="007167">Behold! thy Lord did declare that He would send against them, to the Day of Judgment, those who would afflict them with grievous chastisement. Thy Lord is quick in retribution, but He is also Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007168">We broke them up into sections on this earth. There are among them some that are the righteous, and some that are the opposite. We have tried them with both prosperity and adversity: In order that they might turn (to Us).</AYA>
		<AYA id="007169">After them succeeded an (evil) generation: They inherited the Book, but they chose (for themselves) the vanities of this world, saying (for excuse): "(Everything) will be forgiven us." (Even so), if similar vanities came their way, they would (again) seize them. Was not the covenant of the Book taken from them, that they would not ascribe to Allah anything but the truth? and they study what is in the Book. But best for the righteous is the Home in the Hereafter. Will ye not understand?</AYA>
		<AYA id="007170">As to those who hold fast by the Book and establish regular prayer,- never shall We suffer the reward of the righteous to perish.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007171">When We raised the Mount over them, as if it had been a canopy, and they thought it was going to fall on them (We said): "Hold firmly to what We have given you, and bring (ever) to remembrance what is therein; perchance ye may fear Allah."</AYA>
		<AYA id="007172">When thy Lord drew forth from the Children of Adam - from their loins - their descendants, and made them testify concerning themselves, (saying): "Am I not your Lord (Who cherishes and sustains you)?"- They said: "Yea! We do testify!" (This), lest ye should say on the Day of Judgment: "Of this we were never mindful":</AYA>
		<AYA id="007173">Or lest ye should say: "Our fathers before us took false gods, but we are (their) descendants after them: wilt Thou then destroy us because of the deeds of men who were followed falsehood?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="007174">Thus do We explain the Signs in detail; and perchance they may turn (unto Us).</AYA>
		<AYA id="007175">Relate to them the story of the man to whom We sent Our Signs, but he passed them by: so Satan followed him up, and he went astray.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007176">If it had been Our Will, We should have elevated him with Our Signs; but he inclined to the earth, and followed his own vain desires. His similitude is that of a dog: if you attack him, he lolls out his tongue, or if you leave him alone, he (still) lolls out his tongue. That is the similitude of those who reject Our Signs; so relate the story; perchance they may reflect.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007177">Evil as an example are people who reject Our Signs and wrong their own souls.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007178">Whom Allah doth guide,- he is on the right path: whom He rejects from His guidance,- such are the persons who lose.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007179">Many are the Jinns and men we have made for Hell: They have hearts wherewith they understand not, eyes wherewith they see not, and ears wherewith they hear not. They are like cattle,- nay more misguided: for they are heedless (of warning).</AYA>
		<AYA id="007180">The most beautiful names belong to Allah: so call on him by them; but shun such men as distort His names: for what they do, they will soon be requited.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007181">Of those We have created are people who direct (others) with truth. And dispense justice  therewith.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007182">Those who reject Our Signs, We shall lead them gradually to ruin, while they known not;</AYA>
		<AYA id="007183">Respite will I grant unto them: for My scheme is strong (and unfailing).</AYA>
		<AYA id="007184">Do they not reflect? Their companion is not seized with madness: he is but a perspicuous warner.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007185">Do they see nothing in the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and all that Allah hath created? (Do they not see) that it may well be that their terms is nigh drawing to an end? In what message after this will they then believe?</AYA>
		<AYA id="007186">To such as Allah rejects from His guidance, there can be no guide: He will leave them in their trespasses, wandering in distraction.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007187">They ask thee about the (final) Hour - when will be its appointed time? Say: "The knowledge thereof is with my Lord (alone): None but He can reveal as to when it will occur. Heavy were its burden through the heavens and the earth. Only, all of a sudden will it come to you." They ask thee as if thou wert eager in search thereof: Say: "The knowledge thereof is with Allah (alone), but most men know not."</AYA>
		<AYA id="007188">Say: "I have no power over any good or harm to myself except as Allah willeth. If I had knowledge of the unseen, I should have multiplied all good, and no evil should have touched me: I am but a warner, and a bringer of glad tidings to those who have faith."</AYA>
		<AYA id="007189">It is He Who created you from a single person, and made his mate of like nature, in order that he might dwell with her (in love). When they are united, she bears a light burden and carries it about (unnoticed). When she grows heavy, they both pray to Allah their Lord, (saying): "If Thou givest us a goodly child, we vow we shall (ever) be grateful."</AYA>
		<AYA id="007190">But when He giveth them a goodly child, they ascribe to others a share in the gift they have received: but Allah is exalted high above the partners they ascribe to Him.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007191">Do they indeed ascribe to Him as partners things that can create nothing, but are themselves created?</AYA>
		<AYA id="007192">No aid can they give them, nor can they aid themselves!</AYA>
		<AYA id="007193">If ye call them to guidance, they will not obey: For you it is the same whether ye call them or ye keep silent!</AYA>
		<AYA id="007194">Verily those whom ye call upon besides Allah are servants like unto you: Call upon them, and let them listen to your prayer, if ye are (indeed) truthful!</AYA>
		<AYA id="007195">Have they feet to walk with? Or hands to lay hold with? Or eyes to see with? Or ears to hear with? Say: "Call your 'god-partners', scheme (your worst) against me, and give me no respite!</AYA>
		<AYA id="007196">"For my Protector is Allah, Who revealed the Book (from time to time), and He will befriend the righteous.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007197">"But those ye call upon besides Him, are unable to help you, and indeed to help themselves."</AYA>
		<AYA id="007198">If thou callest them to guidance, they hear not. Thou wilt see them looking at thee, but they see not.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007199">Hold to forgiveness; command what is right; But turn away from the ignorant.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007200">If a suggestion from Satan assail thy (mind), seek refuge with Allah; for He heareth and knoweth (all things).</AYA>
		<AYA id="007201">Those who fear Allah, when a thought of evil from Satan assaults them, bring Allah to remembrance, when lo! they see (aright)!</AYA>
		<AYA id="007202">But their brethren (the evil ones) plunge them deeper into error, and never relax (their efforts).</AYA>
		<AYA id="007203">If thou bring them not a revelation, they say: "Why hast thou not got it together?" Say: "I but follow what is revealed to me   from my Lord: this is (nothing but) Lights from your Lord, and Guidance, and Mercy, for any who have faith."</AYA>
		<AYA id="007204">When the Quran is read, listen to it with attention, and hold your peace: that ye may receive Mercy.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007205">And do thou (O reader!) Bring thy Lord to remembrance in thy (very) soul, with humility, and remember without loudness in words, in the mornings and evenings; and be not thou of those who are unheedful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007206">Those who are near to thy Lord, disdain not to worship Him: They glorify Him, and prostrate before Him.</AYA>

	<SOURA id="8" name="The Spoils Of War">
		<AYA id="008001">They ask thee concerning (things taken as) spoils of war. Say: "(Such) spoils are at the disposal of Allah and the Messenger. So fear Allah, and keep straight the relations between yourselves: Obey Allah and His Messenger, if ye do believe."</AYA>
		<AYA id="008002">For, Believers are those who, when Allah is mentioned, feel a tremor in their hearts, and when they hear His revelations rehearsed, find their faith strengthened, and put (all) their trust in their Lord;</AYA>
		<AYA id="008003">Who establish regular prayers and spend (freely) out of the gifts We have given them for sustenance:</AYA>
		<AYA id="008004">Such in truth are the Believers: they have grades of dignity with their Lord, and forgiveness, and generous sustenance:</AYA>
		<AYA id="008005">Just as thy Lord ordered thee out of thy house in truth, even though a party among the Believers disliked it,</AYA>
		<AYA id="008006">Disputing with thee concerning the truth after it was made manifest, as if they were being driven to death while they see it.</AYA>
		<AYA id="008007">Behold! Allah promised you one of the two (enemy) parties, that it should be yours: Ye wished that the one unarmed should be yours, but Allah willed to establish the Truth according to His words and to cut off the roots of the Unbelievers;-</AYA>
		<AYA id="008008">That He might establish Truth and prove Falsehood false, distasteful though it be to those in guilt.</AYA>
		<AYA id="008009">Remember ye implored the assistance of your Lord, and He answered you: "I will assist you with a thousand of the angels, ranks on ranks."</AYA>
		<AYA id="008010">Allah made it but a message of hope, and an assurance to your hearts: (in any case) there is no help except from Allah: and Allah is Exalted in Power, Wise.</AYA>
		<AYA id="008011">Remember He covered you with drowsiness, to give you calm as from Himself, and He caused rain to descend on you from heaven, to clean you therewith, to remove from you the stain of Satan, to strengthen your hearts, and to plant your feet firmly therewith.</AYA>
		<AYA id="008012">Remember thy Lord inspired the angels (with the message): "I am with you: give firmness to the Believers: I will instill terror into the hearts of the Unbelievers: smite ye above their necks and smite all their finger-tips off them."</AYA>
		<AYA id="008013">This because they contended against Allah and His Messenger: if any contend against Allah and His Messenger, Allah is strict in punishment.</AYA>
		<AYA id="008014">Thus (will it be said): "Taste ye then of the (punishment): for those who reject, is the Chastisement of the Fire."</AYA>
		<AYA id="008015">O ye who believe! when ye meet the Unbelievers in hostile array, never turn your backs to them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="008016">If any do turn his back to them on such a day - unless it be in a stratagem of war, or to retreat to a troop (of his own)- he draws on himself the wrath of Allah, and his abode is Hell,- an evil refuge (indeed)!</AYA>
		<AYA id="008017">It is not ye who slew them; it was Allah. When thou threwest (a handful of dust), it was not thy act, but Allah's: in order that He might confer on the Believers a gracious benefit from Himself: for Allah is He Who heareth and knoweth (all things).</AYA>
		<AYA id="008018">That, and also because Allah is He Who makes feeble the plans and stratagem of the Unbelievers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="008019">(O Unbelievers!) if ye prayed for victory and judgment, now hath the judgment come to you: if ye desist (from wrong), it will be best for you: if ye return (to the attack), so shall We. Not the least good will your forces be to you even if they were multiplied: for verily Allah is with those who believe!</AYA>
		<AYA id="008020">O ye who believe! Obey Allah and His Messenger, and turn not away from him when ye hear (him speak).</AYA>
		<AYA id="008021">Nor be like those who say, "We hear," but listen not:</AYA>
		<AYA id="008022">For the worst of beasts in the sight of Allah are the deaf and the dumb,- those who understand not.</AYA>
		<AYA id="008023">If Allah had found in them any good. He would indeed have made them listen: (As it is), if He had made them listen, they would but have turned back and declined (faith).</AYA>
		<AYA id="008024">O ye who believe! give your response to Allah and His Messenger, when He calleth you to that which will give you life; and know that Allah cometh in between a man and his heart, and that it is He to Whom ye shall (all) be gathered.</AYA>
		<AYA id="008025">And fear the trail, which affecteth not in particular (only) those of you who do wrong: and know that Allah is strict in punishment.</AYA>
		<AYA id="008026">Call to mind when ye were a small (band), deemed weak through the land, and afraid that men might despoil and kidnap you; But He provided a safe asylum for you, strengthened you with His aid, and gave you Good things for sustenance: that ye might be grateful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="008027">O ye that believe! betray not the trust of Allah and the Messenger, nor misappropriate knowingly things entrusted to you.</AYA>
		<AYA id="008028">And know ye that your possessions and your progeny are but a trial; and that it is Allah with Whom lies your highest reward.</AYA>
		<AYA id="008029">O ye who believe! if ye fear Allah, He will grant you a Criterion (to judge between right and wrong), remove from you (all) evil deeds you, and forgive you: for Allah is the Lord of Grace unbounded.</AYA>
		<AYA id="008030">Remember how the Unbelievers plotted against thee, to keep thee in bonds, or slay thee, or get thee out (of thy home). They plot and plan, and Allah too plans; but the best of planners is Allah.</AYA>
		<AYA id="008031">When Our Signs are rehearsed to them, they say: "We have heard this (before): if we wished, we could say (words) like these: these are nothing but tales of the ancients."</AYA>
		<AYA id="008032">Remember how they said: "O Allah! if this is indeed the Truth from Thee, rain down on us a shower of stones form the sky, or send us a grievous chastisement."</AYA>
		<AYA id="008033">But Allah was not going to send them a chastisement whilst thou wast amongst them; nor was He going to send it whilst they could ask for pardon.</AYA>
		<AYA id="008034">But what plea have they that Allah should not punish them, when they keep out (men) from the Sacred Mosque - and they are not its guardians? No men can be its guardians except the righteous; but most of them do not understand.</AYA>
		<AYA id="008035">Their prayer at the House (of Allah) is nothing but whistling and clapping of hands: (Its only answer can be), "Taste ye the Chastisement because ye blasphemed."</AYA>
		<AYA id="008036">The Unbelievers spend their wealth to hinder (man) from the path of Allah, and so will they continue to spend; but in the end they will have (only) regrets and sighs; at length they will be overcome: and the Unbelievers will be gathered together to Hell;-</AYA>
		<AYA id="008037">In order that Allah may separate the impure from the pure, put the impure, one on another, heap them together, and cast them into Hell. They will be the ones to have lost.</AYA>
		<AYA id="008038">Say to the Unbelievers, if (now) they desist (from Unbelief), their past would be forgiven them; but if they persist, the punishment of those before them is already (a matter of warning for them).</AYA>
		<AYA id="008039">And fight them on until there is no more persecution, and religion becomes Allah's in its entirety; but if they cease, verily Allah doth see all that they do.</AYA>
		<AYA id="008040">If they refuse, be sure that Allah is your Protector - the best to protect and the best to help.</AYA>
		<AYA id="008041">And know that out of all the booty that ye may acquire (in war), a fifth share is assigned to Allah,- and to the Messenger, and to near relatives, orphans, the needy, and the wayfarer,- if ye do believe in Allah and in the revelation We sent down to Our Servant on the Day of Discrimination,- the Day of the meeting of the two forces. For Allah hath power over all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="008042">Remember ye were on the hither side of the valley, and they on the farther side, and the caravan on lower ground than ye. Even if ye had made a mutual appointment to meet, ye would certainly have failed in the appointment: But (thus ye met), that Allah might accomplish a matter already decided; that those who died might die after a Clear Sign (had been given), and those who lived might live after a Clear Sign (had been given). And verily Allah is He Who heareth and knoweth (all things).</AYA>
		<AYA id="008043">Remember in thy dream Allah showed them to thee as few: if He had shown them to thee as many, ye would surely have been discouraged, and ye would surely have disputed in (your) decision; but Allah saved (you): for He knoweth well the (secrets) of (all) hearts.</AYA>
		<AYA id="008044">And remember when ye met, He showed them to you as few in your eyes, and He made you appear as contemptible in their eyes: that Allah might accomplish a matter already decided. And unto Allah are all matters returned.</AYA>
		<AYA id="008045">O ye who believe! When ye meet a force, be firm, and call Allah in remembrance much (and often); that ye may prosper:</AYA>
		<AYA id="008046">And obey Allah and His Messenger. and fall into no disputes, lest ye lose heart and your power depart; and be patient and persevering: For Allah is with those who patiently persevere:</AYA>
		<AYA id="008047">And be not like those who started from their homes insolently and to be seen of men, and to hinder (men) from the path of Allah: for Allah compasseth all that they do.</AYA>
		<AYA id="008048">Remember Satan made their (sinful) acts seem alluring to them, and said: "No one among men can overcome you this day, while I am near to you": But when the two forces came in sight of each other, he turned on his heels, and said: "Lo! I am clear of you; lo! I see what ye see not; Lo! I fear Allah. for Allah is strict in punishment."</AYA>
		<AYA id="008049">Lo! the Hypocrites and those in whose hearts is a disease, say: "These people,- their religion has misled them." But if any trust in Allah, behold! Allah is Exalted in might, Wise.</AYA>
		<AYA id="008050">If thou couldst see, when the angels take the souls of the Unbelievers (at death), (How) they smite their faces and their backs, (saying): "Taste the Chastisement of the blazing Fire-</AYA>
		<AYA id="008051">This is "Because of (the deeds) which your (own) hands sent forth; for Allah is never unjust to His servants:</AYA>
		<AYA id="008052">"(Deeds) after the manner of the People of Pharaoh and of those before them: They rejected the Signs of Allah, and Allah punished them for their crimes: for Allah is Strong, and Strict in punishment:</AYA>
		<AYA id="008053">"Because Allah will never change the grace which He hath bestowed on a people until they change what is in their (own) souls: and verily Allah is He Who heareth and knoweth (all things)."</AYA>
		<AYA id="008054">(Deeds) after the manner of the People of Pharaoh and those before them": They treated as false the Signs of their Lord, so We destroyed them for their crimes, and We drowned the People of Pharaoh: for they were all oppressors and wrong- doers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="008055">For the worst of beasts in the sight of Allah are those who reject Him: They will not believe.</AYA>
		<AYA id="008056">They are those with whom thou didst make a covenant, but they break their covenant every time, and they have not the fear (of Allah).</AYA>
		<AYA id="008057">If ye gain the mastery over them in war, disperse, with them, those who follow them, that they may remember.</AYA>
		<AYA id="008058">If thou fearest treachery from any group, throw back (their covenant) to them, (so as to be) on equal terms: for Allah loveth not the treacherous.</AYA>
		<AYA id="008059">Let not the Unbelievers think that they have escaped: they will never frustrate (them).</AYA>
		<AYA id="008060">Against them make ready your strength to the utmost of your power, including steeds of war, to strike terror into (the hearts of) the enemies, of Allah and your enemies, and others besides, whom ye may not know, but whom Allah doth know. Whatever ye shall spend in the Cause of Allah, shall be repaid unto you, and ye shall not be treated unjustly.</AYA>
		<AYA id="008061">But if the enemy incline towards peace, do thou (also) incline towards peace, and trust in Allah: for He is the One that heareth and knoweth (all things).</AYA>
		<AYA id="008062">Should they intend to deceive thee,- verily Allah sufficeth thee: He it is that hath strengthened thee with His aid and with (the company of) the Believers;</AYA>
		<AYA id="008063">And (moreover) He hath put affection between their hearts: not if thou hadst spent all that is in the earth, couldst thou have produced that affection, but Allah hath done it: for He is Exalted in might, Wise.</AYA>
		<AYA id="008064">O Prophet! sufficient unto thee is Allah,- (unto thee) and unto those who follow thee among the Believers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="008065">O Prophet! Rouse the Believers to the fight. If there are twenty amongst you, patient and persevering, they will vanquish two hundred: if a hundred, they will vanquish a thousand of the Unbelievers: for these are a people without understanding.</AYA>
		<AYA id="008066">For the present, Allah hath lightened your (burden), for He knoweth that there is a weak spot in you: But (even so), if there are a hundred of you, patient and persevering, they will vanquish two hundred, and if a thousand, they will vanquish two thousand, with the leave of Allah: for Allah is with those who patiently persevere.</AYA>
		<AYA id="008067">It is not fitting for a Prophet that he should have prisoners of war until he hath thoroughly subdued the land. Ye look for the temporal goods of this world; but Allah looketh to the Hereafter: And Allah is Exalted in might, Wise.</AYA>
		<AYA id="008068">Had it not been for a previous ordainment from Allah, a severe punishment would have reached you for the (ransom) that ye took.</AYA>
		<AYA id="008069">But (now) enjoy what ye took in war, lawful and good: but fear Allah. for Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="008070">O Prophet! say to those who are captives in your hands: "If Allah findeth any good in your hearts, He will give you something better than what has been taken from you, and He will forgive you: for Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful."</AYA>
		<AYA id="008071">But if they have treacherous designs against thee, (O Messenger!), they have already been in treason against Allah, and so hath He given (thee) power over them. And Allah is He Who hath (full) knowledge and wisdom.</AYA>
		<AYA id="008072">Those who believed, and emigrated, and fought for the Faith, with their property and their persons, in the Cause of Allah, as well as those who gave (them) asylum and aid,- these are (all) friends and protectors, one of another. As to those who believed but did not emigrate, ye owe no duty of protection to them until they emigrate; but if they seek your aid in religion, it is your duty to help them, except against a people with whom ye have a treaty of mutual alliance. And (remember) Allah seeth all that ye do.</AYA>
		<AYA id="008073">The Unbelievers are protectors, one of another: unless ye do this, (protect each other), there would be tumult and oppression on earth, and great mischief.</AYA>
		<AYA id="008074">Those who believe, and emigrate, and fight for the Faith, in the Cause of Allah as well as those who give (them) asylum and aid,- these are (all) in very truth the Believers: for them is the forgiveness of sins and a provision most generous.</AYA>
		<AYA id="008075">And those who accept Faith subsequently, and emigrate, and fight for the Faith in your company,- they are of you. But kindred by blood have prior rights against each other in the Book of Allah. Verily Allah is well-acquainted with all things.</AYA>

	<SOURA id="9" name="Repentance">
		<AYA id="009001">A (declaration) of immunity from Allah and His Messenger, to those of the Pagans with whom ye have contracted mutual alliances:-</AYA>
		<AYA id="009002">Go ye, then, for four months (backwards and forwards, as ye will), throughout the land, but know ye that ye cannot frustrate Allah (by your falsehood) but that Allah will cover with shame those who reject Him.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009003">And an announcement from Allah and His Messenger, to the people (assembled) on the day of the Great Pilgrimage,- that Allah and His Messenger dissolve (treaty) obligations with the Pagans. If then, ye repent, it were best for you; but if ye turn away, know ye that ye cannot frustrate Allah. And proclaim a grievous chastisement to those who reject Faith.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009004">(But the treaties are) not dissolved with those Pagans with whom ye have entered into alliance and who have not subsequently failed you in aught, nor aided any one against you. So fulfill your engagements with them to the end of their term: for Allah loveth the righteous.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009005">But when the forbidden months are past, then fight and slay the Pagans wherever ye find them, and seize them, beleaguer them, and lie in wait for them in every stratagem (of war); but if they repent, and establish regular prayers and pay Zakat, then open the way for them: for Allah is Oft- forgiving, Most Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009006">If one amongst the Pagans ask thee for asylum, grant it to him, so that he may hear the Word of Allah; and then escort him to where he can be secure. That is because they are men without knowledge.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009007">How can there be a covenant, before Allah and His Messenger, with the Pagans, except those with whom ye made a treaty near the Sacred Mosque? As long as these stand true to you, stand ye true to them: for Allah doth love the righteous.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009008">How (can there be such a covenant), seeing that if they get an advantage over you, they respect not in you the ties either of kinship or of covenant? With (fair words from) their mouths they please you, but their hearts are averse from you; and most of them are rebellious and wicked.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009009">The Words of Allah have they sold for a miserable price, and (many) have they hindered from His Way: evil indeed are the deeds they have done.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009010">In a Believer they respect not the ties either of kinship or of covenant! It is they who have transgressed all bounds.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009011">But (even so), if they repent, establish regular prayers, and pay Zakat,- they are your brethren in Faith: (thus) do We explain the Signs in detail, for those who understand.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009012">But if they violate their oaths after their covenant, and attack you for your Faith,- fight ye the chiefs of Unfaith: for their oaths are nothing to them: that thus they may be restrained.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009013">Will ye not fight people who violated their oaths, plotted to expel the Messenger, and attacked you first? Do ye fear them? Nay, it is Allah Whom ye should more justly fear, if ye believe!</AYA>
		<AYA id="009014">Fight them, and Allah will punish them by your hands, and disgrace them, help you (to victory) over them, heal the breasts of Believers,</AYA>
		<AYA id="009015">And still the indignation of their hearts. For Allah will turn (in mercy) to whom He will; and Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009016">Do you think that you would be left alone while Allah has not yet known those among you who strive with might and main, and take none for friends and protectors except Allah, His Messenger, and the (community of) Believers? And Allah is well-acquainted with (all) that ye do.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009017">It is not for such as join gods with Allah, to maintain the mosques of Allah while they witness against their own souls to infidelity. The works of such bear no fruit: In Fire shall they dwell.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009018">The mosques of Allah shall be visited and maintained by such as believe in Allah and the Last Day, establish regular prayers, and pay Zakat, and fear none (at all) except Allah. It is they who are expected to be on true guidance.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009019">Do ye consider the giving of drink to pilgrims, or the maintenance of the Sacred Mosque, equal to (the pious service of) those who believe in Allah and the Last Day, and strive with might and main in the Cause of Allah. They are not equal in the sight of Allah. and Allah guides not those who do wrong.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009020">Those who believe, and emigrate and strive with might and main, in Allah's Cause, with their goods and their persons, have the highest rank in the sight of Allah. they are the people who will achieve (salvation).</AYA>
		<AYA id="009021">Their Lord doth give them Glad tidings of a Mercy from Himself, of His good pleasure, and of Gardens for them, wherein are delights that endure:</AYA>
		<AYA id="009022">They will dwell therein for ever. Verily with Allah is a reward, the greatest (of all).</AYA>
		<AYA id="009023">O ye who believe! take not for protectors your fathers and your brothers if they love Infidelity above Faith: if any of you do so, they do wrong.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009024">Say: If it be that your fathers, your sons, your brothers, your mates, or your kindred; the wealth that ye have gained; the commerce in which ye fear a decline: or the dwellings in which ye delight - are dearer to you than Allah, or His Messenger, or the striving in His cause;- then wait until Allah brings about His Decision: and Allah guides not the rebellious.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009025">Assuredly Allah did help you in many battle-fields and on the day of Hunain: Behold! your great numbers elated you, but they availed you naught: the land, for all that it is wide, did constrain you, and ye turned back in retreat.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009026">But Allah did pour His calm on the Messenger and on the Believers, and sent down forces which ye saw not: He punished the Unbelievers; thus doth He reward those without Faith.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009027">Again will Allah, after this, turn (in mercy) to whom He will: for Allah is Oft- forgiving, Most Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009028">O ye who believe! Truly the Pagans are unclean; so let them not, after this year of theirs, approach the Sacred Mosque. And if ye fear poverty, soon will Allah enrich you, if He wills, out of His bounty, for Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009029">Fight those who believe not in Allah nor the Last Day, nor hold that forbidden which hath been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger, nor acknowledge the Religion of Truth, from among the People of the Book, until they pay the Jizya with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009030">The Jews call zair a son of Allah, and the Christians call Christ the son of Allah. That is a saying from their mouth; (in this) they but imitate what the unbelievers of old used to say. Allah's curse be on them: how they are deluded away from the Truth!</AYA>
		<AYA id="009031">They take their priests and their anchorites to be their lords beside Allah, and (they take as their Lord) Christ the son of Mary; yet they were commanded to worship but One God. there is no god but He. Praise and glory to Him: (Far is He) from having the partners they associate (with Him).</AYA>
		<AYA id="009032">Fain would they extinguish Allah's Light with their mouths, but Allah will not allow but that His Light should be perfected, even though the Unbelievers may detest (it).</AYA>
		<AYA id="009033">It is He Who hath sent His Messenger with Guidance and the Religion of Truth, to cause it to prevail over all religion, even though the Pagans may detest (it).</AYA>
		<AYA id="009034">O ye who believe! there are indeed many among the priests and anchorites, who in falsehood devour the wealth of men and hinder (them) from the Way of Allah. And there are those who hoard gold and silver and spend it not in the Way of Allah: announce unto them a most grievous chastisement-</AYA>
		<AYA id="009035">On the Day when it will be heated in the fire of Hell, and with it will be branded their foreheads, their flanks, and their backs.- "This is the (treasure) which ye hoarded for yourselves: taste ye, then, the (treasures) ye buried!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="009036">The number of months in the sight of Allah is twelve (in a year)- so ordained by Him the day He created the heavens and the earth; of them four are sacred: that is the right religion. So wrong not yourselves therein. And fight the Pagans all together as they fight you all together. But know that Allah is with those who restrain themselves.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009037">Verily the transposing (of a prohibited month) is an addition to Unbelief: the Unbelievers are led to wrong thereby: for they make it lawful one year, and forbidden another year, in order to agree with the number of months forbidden by Allah and make such forbidden ones lawful. The evil of their course seems pleasing to them. But Allah guideth not those who reject Faith.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009038">O ye who believe! what is the matter with you, that, when ye are asked to go forth in the Cause of Allah, ye cling heavily to the earth? Do ye prefer the life of this world to the Hereafter? But little is the comfort of this life, as compared with the Hereafter.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009039">Unless ye go forth, He will punish you with a grievous penalty, and put others in your place; but Him ye would not harm in the least. For Allah hath power over all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009040">If ye help not (your Prophet), (it is no matter): for Allah did indeed help him, when the Unbelievers drove him out: being the second of the two; they two were in the Cave, and he said to his companion, "Have no fear, for Allah is with us": then Allah sent down His peace upon him, and strengthened him with forces which ye saw not, and humbled to the depths the word of the Unbelievers. But the Word of Allah is exalted to the heights: for Allah is Exalted in might, Wise.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009041">Go ye forth, (whether equipped) lightly or heavily, and strive and struggle, with your goods and your persons, in the Cause of Allah. That is best for you, if ye (but) knew.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009042">If there had been immediate gain (in sight), and the journey easy, they would (all) without doubt have followed thee, but the distance was long, (and weighed) on them. They would indeed swear by Allah, "If we only could, we should certainly have come out with you": They would destroy their own souls; for Allah doth know that they are certainly lying.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009043">Allah give thee grace! Why didst thou grant them exemption until those who told the truth were seen by thee in a clear light, and thou hadst proved the liars?</AYA>
		<AYA id="009044">Those who believe in Allah and the Last Day ask thee for no exemption from fighting with their goods and persons. And Allah knoweth well those who do their duty.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009045">Only those ask thee for exemption who believe not in Allah and the Last Day, and whose hearts are in doubt, so that they are tossed in their doubts to and fro.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009046">If they had intended to come out, they would certainly have made some preparation therefor; but Allah was averse to their being sent forth; so He made them lag behind, and they were told, "Sit ye among those who sit (inactive)."</AYA>
		<AYA id="009047">If they had come out with you, they would not have added to your (strength) but only (made for) disorder, hurrying to and fro in your midst and sowing sedition among you, and there would have been some among you who would have listened to them. But Allah knoweth well those who do wrong.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009048">Indeed they had plotted sedition before, and upset matters for thee, until,- the Truth arrived, and the Decree of Allah became manifest much to their disgust.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009049">Among them is (many) a man who says: "Grant me exemption and draw me not into trial." Have they not fallen into trial already? and indeed Hell surrounds the Unbelievers (on all sides).</AYA>
		<AYA id="009050">If good befalls thee, it grieves them; but if a misfortune befalls thee, they say, "We took indeed our precautions beforehand," and they turn away rejoicing.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009051">Say: "Nothing will happen to us except what Allah has decreed for us: He is our Protector": and on Allah let the Believers put their trust.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009052">Say: "Can you expect for us (any fate) other than one of two glorious things- (martyrdom or victory)? But we can expect for you either that Allah will send His punishment from Him, or by our hands. So wait (expectant); we too will wait with you."</AYA>
		<AYA id="009053">Say: "Spend (for the Cause) willingly or unwillingly: not from you will it be accepted: for ye are indeed a people rebellious and wicked."</AYA>
		<AYA id="009054">The only reasons why their contributions are not accepted are: that they reject Allah and His Messenger; that they come to prayer save lazily; and that they offer contributions unwillingly.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009055">Let not their wealth nor their children dazzle thee: in reality Allah's wish is to punish them with these things in this life, and that their souls may perish in their (very) denial of Allah.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009056">They swear by Allah that they are indeed of you; but they are not of you: yet they are afraid (of you).</AYA>
		<AYA id="009057">If they could find a place to flee to, or caves, or a place of concealment, they would turn straightway thereto, with an obstinate rush.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009058">And among them are men who slander thee in the matter of (the distribution of) the alms: if they are given part thereof, they are pleased, but if not, behold! they are indignant!</AYA>
		<AYA id="009059">If only they had been content with what Allah and His Messenger gave them, and had said, "Sufficient unto us is Allah. Allah and His Messenger will soon give us of His bounty: to Allah do we turn our hopes!" (that would have been the right course).</AYA>
		<AYA id="009060">Alms are for the poor and the needy, and those employed to administer the (funds); for those whose hearts have been (recently) reconciled (to Truth); for those in bondage and in debt; in the Cause of Allah; and for the wayfarer: (thus is it) ordained by Allah, and Allah is full of knowledge and wisdom.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009061">Among them are men who molest the Prophet and say, "He is (all) ear." Say, "He listens to what is best for you: he believes in Allah, has faith in the Believers, and is a Mercy to those of you who believe." But those who molest the Messenger will have a grievous chastisement.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009062">To you they swear by Allah in order to please you: But it is more fitting that they should please Allah and His Messenger, if they are Believers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009063">Know they not that for those who oppose Allah and His Messenger, is the Fire of Hell?- wherein they shall dwell. That is the supreme disgrace.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009064">The Hypocrites are afraid lest a Srah should be sent down about them, showing them what is (really passing) in their hearts. Say: "Mock ye! But verily Allah will bring to light all that ye fear (should be revealed).</AYA>
		<AYA id="009065">If thou dost question them, they declare (with emphasis): "We were only talking idly and in play." Say: "Was it at Allah, and His Signs, and His Messenger, that ye were mocking?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="009066">Make ye no excuses: ye have rejected Faith after ye had accepted it. If We pardon some of you, We will punish others amongst you, for that they are sinners.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009067">The Hypocrites, men and women, are alike with each other: They enjoin evil, and forbid what is just, and tighten their purse's strings. They have forgotten Allah; so He hath forgotten them. Verily the Hypocrites are rebellious and perverse.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009068">Allah hath promised the Hypocrites men and women, and the rejecters of Faith, the fire of Hell: Therein shall they dwell: Sufficient is it for them: for them is the curse of Allah, and an enduring punishment,-</AYA>
		<AYA id="009069">As in the case of those before you: they were mightier than you in power, and more flourishing in wealth and children. They had their enjoyment of their portion: and ye have of yours, as did those before you; and ye indulge in idle talk as they did. They!- their work are fruitless in this world and in the Hereafter, and they are the losers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009070">Hath not the story reached them of those before them?- the People of Noah, and d, and Thamd; the People of Abraham, the men of Midian, and the Cities overthrown. To them came their messengers with Clear Signs. It is not Allah Who wrongs them, but they wrong their own souls.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009071">The Believers, men and women, are protectors one of another: they enjoin what is just, and forbid what is evil: they observe regular prayers, pay Zakat, and obey Allah and His Messenger. On them will Allah pour His mercy: for Allah is Exalted in power, Wise.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009072">Allah hath promised to Believers, men and women, Gardens under which rivers flow, to dwell therein, and beautiful mansions in Gardens of everlasting stay. But the greatest bliss is the Good Pleasure of Allah. that is the supreme felicity.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009073">O Prophet! strive hard against the Unbelievers and the Hypocrites, and be firm against them. Their abode is Hell,- an evil refuge indeed.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009074">They swear by Allah that they said nothing (evil), but indeed they uttered blasphemy, and they uttered it after accepting Islm; and they meditated a plot which they were unable to carry out: this revenge of theirs was (their) only return for the bounty with which Allah and His Messenger had enriched them! If they repent, it will be best for them; but if they turn back (to their evil ways), Allah will punish them with a grievous chastisement in this life and in the Hereafter: They shall have none on earth to protect or help them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009075">Amongst them are men who made a covenant with Allah, that if He bestowed on them of His bounty, they would give (largely) in charity, and be truly amongst those who are righteous.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009076">But when He did bestow of His bounty, they became misers, and turned back (from their covenant), averse (from its fulfillment).</AYA>
		<AYA id="009077">So He hath put as a consequence hypocrisy into their hearts, (to last) till the Day whereon they shall meet Him: because they broke their covenant with Allah, and because they lied (again and again).</AYA>
		<AYA id="009078">Know they not that Allah doth know their secret (thoughts) and their secret counsels, and that Allah knoweth well all things unseen?</AYA>
		<AYA id="009079">Those who slander such of the believers as give themselves freely to (deeds of) charity, as well as such as can find nothing to give except the fruits of their labor,- and throw ridicule on them,- Allah will throw back their ridicule on them: and they shall have a grievous chastisement.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009080">Whether thou ask for their forgiveness, or not, (their sin is unforgivable): if thou ask seventy times for their forgiveness, Allah will not forgive them: because they have rejected Allah and His Messenger. and Allah guideth not those who are perversely rebellious.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009081">Those who were left behind (in the Tabk expedition) rejoiced in their inaction behind the Messenger of Allah: they hated to strive and fight, with their goods and their persons, in the Cause of Allah. they said, "Go not forth in the heat." Say, "The fire of Hell is fiercer in heat." If only they could understand!</AYA>
		<AYA id="009082">Let them laugh a little: much will they weep: a recompense for the (evil) that they do.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009083">If, then, Allah bring thee back to any of them, and they ask thy permission to come out (with thee), say: "Never shall ye come out with me, nor fight an enemy with me: for ye preferred to sit inactive on the first occasion: Then sit ye (now) with those who lag behind."</AYA>
		<AYA id="009084">Nor do thou ever pray for any of them that dies, nor stand at his grave; for they rejected Allah and His Messenger, and died in a state of perverse rebellion.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009085">Nor let their wealth nor their children dazzle thee: Allah's wish is to punish them with these things in this world, and that their souls may depart while they are unbelievers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009086">When a Srah comes down, enjoining them to believe in Allah and to strive and fight along with His Messenger, those with wealth and influence among them ask thee for exemption, and say: "Leave us (behind): we would be with those who sit (at home)."</AYA>
		<AYA id="009087">They prefer to be with (the women), who remain behind (at home): their hearts are sealed and so they understand not.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009088">But the Messenger, and those who believe with him, strive and fight with their wealth and their persons: for them are (all) good things: and it is they who will prosper.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009089">Allah hath prepared for them Gardens under which rivers flow, to dwell therein: that is the supreme triumph.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009090">And there were, among the desert Arabs (also), men who made excuses and came to claim exemption; and those who were false to Allah and His Messenger (merely) sat behind. Soon will a grievous chastisement seize the Unbelievers among them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009091">There is no blame on those who are infirm, or ill, or who find no resources to spend (on the cause), if they are sincere (in duty) to Allah and His Messenger: no ground (of complaint) can there be against such as do right: and Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009092">Nor (is there blame) on those who came to thee to be provided with mounts, and when thou saidst, "I can find no mounts for you," they turned back, their eyes streaming with tears of grief that they had no resources wherewith to provide the expenses.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009093">The ground (of complaint) is against such as claim exemption while they are rich. They prefer to stay with the (women) who remain behind: Allah hath sealed their hearts; so they know not.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009094">They will present their excuses to you when ye return to them. Say thou: "Present no excuses: we shall not believe you: Allah hath already informed us of the true state of matters concerning you: It is your actions that Allah and His Messenger will observe: in the end will ye be brought back to Him Who knoweth what is hidden and what is open: then will He show you the truth of all that ye did."</AYA>
		<AYA id="009095">They will swear to you by Allah, when ye return to them, that ye may leave them alone. So leave them alone: For they are an abomination, and Hell is their dwelling-place,-a fitting recompense for the (evil) that they did.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009096">They will swear unto you, that ye may be pleased with them, but if ye are pleased with them, Allah is not pleased with those who disobey.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009097">The Bedouin Arabs are the worst in Unbelief and hypocrisy, and most fitted to be in ignorance of the command which Allah hath sent down to His Messenger. But Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009098">Some of the Bedouin Arabs look upon their payments as a fine, and watch for disasters for you: on them be the disaster of evil: for Allah is He That heareth and knoweth (all things).</AYA>
		<AYA id="009099">But some of the desert Arabs believe in Allah and the Last Day, and look on their payments as pious gifts bringing them nearer to Allah and obtaining the prayers of the Messenger. Aye, indeed they bring them nearer (to Him): soon will Allah admit them to His Mercy: for Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009100">The vanguard (of Islm)- the first of those who forsook (their homes) and of those who gave them aid, and (also) those who follow them in (all) good deeds,- well- pleased is Allah with them, as are they with Him: for them hath He prepared Gardens under which rivers flow, to dwell therein for ever: that is the supreme triumph.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009101">Certain of the desert Arabs round about you are hypocrites, as well as among the Madinah folk: they are obstinate in hypocrisy: thou knowest them not: We know them: twice shall We punish them: and in addition shall they be sent to a grievous chastisement.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009102">Others (there are who) have acknowledged their wrong-doings: they have mixed an act that was good with another that was evil. Perhaps Allah will turn unto them (in Mercy): for Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009103">Of their wealth, take alms, that so thou mightest purify and sanctify them; and pray on their behalf. Verily thy prayers are a source of security for them: And Allah is One Who heareth and knoweth.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009104">Know they not that Allah doth accept repentance from His votaries and receives their gifts of charity, and that Allah is verily He, the Oft-Returning, Most Merciful?</AYA>
		<AYA id="009105">And say: "Work (righteousness): Soon will Allah observe your work, and His Messenger, and the Believers: Soon will ye be brought back to the Knower of what is hidden and what is open: then will He show you the truth of all that ye did."</AYA>
		<AYA id="009106">There are (yet) others, held in suspense for the command of Allah, whether He will punish them, or turn in mercy to them: and Allah is All-Knowing, Wise.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009107">And there are those who put up a mosque by way of mischief and infidelity - to disunite the Believers - and in preparation for one who warred against Allah and His Messenger aforetime. They will indeed swear that their intention is nothing but good; but Allah doth declare that they are certainly liars.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009108">Never stand thou forth therein. There is a mosque whose foundation was laid from the first day on piety; it is more worthy of thy standing forth (for prayer) therein. In it are men who love to be purified; and Allah loveth those who make themselves pure.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009109">Which then is best? - he that layeth his foundation on piety to Allah and His Good Pleasure? - or he that layeth his foundation on an undermined sand-cliff ready to crumble to pieces? and it doth crumble to pieces with him, into the fire of Hell. And Allah guideth not people that do wrong.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009110">The foundation of those who so build is never free from suspicion and shakiness in their hearts, until their hearts are cut to pieces. And Allah is All-Knowing, Wise.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009111">Allah hath purchased of the believers their persons and their goods; for theirs (in return) is the Garden (of Paradise): they fight in His Cause, and slay and are slain: a promise binding on Him in Truth, through the Torah, the Gospel, and the Quran: and who is more faithful to his Covenant than Allah? Then rejoice in the bargain which ye have concluded: that is the achievement supreme.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009112">Those that turn (to Allah) in repentance; that serve Him, and praise Him; that wander in devotion to the Cause of Allah,: that bow down and prostrate themselves in prayer; that enjoin good and forbid evil; and observe the limit set by Allah.- (these do rejoice). So proclaim the glad tidings to the Believers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009113">It is not fitting, for the Prophet and those who believe, that they should pray for forgiveness for Pagans, even though they be of kin, after it is clear to them that they are companions of the Fire.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009114">And Abraham prayed for his father's forgiveness only because of a promise he had made to him. But when it became clear to him that he was an enemy to Allah, he dissociated himself from him: for Abraham was most tender-hearted, forbearing.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009115">And Allah will not mislead a people after He hath guided them, until He makes clear to them as to what they should avoid, for Allah hath knowledge of all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009116">Unto Allah belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth. He giveth life and He taketh it. Except for Him ye have no protector nor helper.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009117">Allah turned with favor to the Prophet, the Muhjirs, and the Ansr,- who followed him in a time of distress, after that the hearts of a part of them had nearly swerved (from duty); but He turned to them (also): for He is unto them Most Kind, Most Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009118">(He turned in mercy also) to the three who were left behind; (they felt guilty) to such a degree that the earth seemed constrained to them, for all its spaciousness, and their (very) souls seemed straitened to them,- and they perceived that there is no fleeing from Allah (and no refuge) but to Himself. Then He turned to them, that they might repent: for Allah is Oft-Returning, Most Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009119">O ye who believe! Fear Allah and be with those who are truthful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009120">It was not fitting for the people of Madinah and the Bedouin Arabs of the neighborhood, to stay behind (and not follow) Allah's Messenger, nor to prefer their own lives to his: because nothing could they suffer or do, but was reckoned to their credit as a deed of righteousness,- whether they suffered thirst, or fatigue, or hunger, in the Cause of Allah, or trod paths to raise the ire of the Unbelievers, or gain any gain from an enemy: for Allah suffereth not the reward to be lost of those who do good;-</AYA>
		<AYA id="009121">Nor could they spend anything (for the Cause) - small or great- nor cut across a valley, but the deed is inscribed to their credit: that Allah may requite them with the best (possible reward).</AYA>
		<AYA id="009122">It is not for the Believers to go forth (all) together: if a contingent from every expedition go forth to devote themselves to studies in religion, and admonish the people when they return to them,- that thus they (may learn) to guard themselves (against evil).</AYA>
		<AYA id="009123">O ye who believe! fight the unbelievers who are near to you, and let them find harshness in you: and know that Allah is with those who fear Him.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009124">Whenever there cometh down a Srah, some of them say: "Which of you has had His faith increased by it?" Yea, those who believe,- their faith is increased and they do rejoice.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009125">But those in whose hearts is a disease,- it will add doubt to their doubt, and they will die in a state of Unbelief.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009126">See they not that they are tried every year once or twice? Yet they turn not in repentance, and they take no heed.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009127">Whenever there cometh down a Srah, they look at each other, (saying), "Doth anyone see you?" Then they turn away: Allah hath turned their hearts (from the light); for they are a people that understand not.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009128">Now hath come unto you a Messenger from amongst yourselves: it grieves him that ye should suffer, ardently anxious is he over you: to the Believers is he most kind and merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009129">But if they turn away, Say: "(Allah) sufficeth me: there is no god but He: On Him is my trust,- He the Lord of the Throne Supreme!"</AYA>

	<SOURA id="10" name="Yunus">
		<AYA id="010001">Alif. Lm. R. These are the ayats of the Book of Wisdom.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010002">Is it a matter of wonderment to men that We have sent Our inspiration to a man from among themselves?- that he should warn mankind (of their danger), and give the good news to the Believers that they have before their Lord the good actions they have advanced. (But) say the Unbelievers: "This is indeed an evident sorcerer!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="010003">Verily your Lord is Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth in six days, then He established Himself on the Throne. Regulating and governing all things. No intercessor (can plead with Him) except after His leave (hath been obtained). This is Allah your Lord; Him therefore serve ye: will ye not receive admonition?</AYA>
		<AYA id="010004">To Him will be your return- of all of you. The promise of Allah is true and sure. It is He Who beginneth the process of creation, and repeateth it, that He may reward with justice those who believe and work righteousness; but those who reject Him will have draughts of boiling fluids, and a chastisement grievous, because they did reject Him.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010005">It is He Who made the sun to be a shining glory and the moon to be a light (of beauty), and measured out stages for it; that ye might know the number of years and the count (of time). Nowise did Allah create this but in truth and righteousness. (Thus) doth He explain His Signs in detail, for those who know.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010006">Verily, in the alternation of the night and the day, and in all that Allah hath created, in the heavens and the earth, are Signs for those who fear Him.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010007">Those who rest not their hope on their meeting with Us, but are pleased and satisfied with the life of the present, and those who heed not Our Signs,-</AYA>
		<AYA id="010008">Their abode is the Fire, because of the (evil) they earned.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010009">Those who believe, and work righteousness,- their Lord will guide them because of their faith: beneath them will flow rivers in Gardens of Bliss.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010010">(This will be) their prayer therein: "Glory to Thee, O Allah!", and "Peace" will be their greeting therein and the end of their prayer will be: "Praise be to Allah, the Cherisher and Sustainer of the Worlds!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="010011">If Allah were to hasten for men the ill (they have earned) as they would fain hasten on the good,- then would their respite be settled at once. But We leave those who rest not their hope on their meeting with Us, in their trespasses, wandering in distraction blindly.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010012">When trouble toucheth a man, He crieth unto Us (in all postures)- lying down on his side, or sitting, or standing. But when We have removed his affliction, he passeth on his way as if he had never cried to Us for the affliction that touched him! thus do the deeds of transgressors seem fair in their eyes!</AYA>
		<AYA id="010013">Generations before you We destroyed when they did wrong: their apostles came to them with Clear-Signs, but they would not believe! thus do We requite those who sin!</AYA>
		<AYA id="010014">Then We made you heirs in the land after them, to see how ye would behave!</AYA>
		<AYA id="010015">But when Our Clear Signs are rehearsed unto them, those who rest not their hope on their meeting with Us, Say: "Bring us a Quran other than this, or change this," Say: "It is not for me, of my own accord, to change it: I follow naught but what is revealed unto me: if I were to disobey my Lord, I should myself fear the Chastisement of a Great Day (to come)."</AYA>
		<AYA id="010016">Say: "If Allah had so willed, I should not have rehearsed it to you, nor should He have made it known to you. A whole life-time before this have I tarried amongst you: will ye not then understand?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="010017">Who doth more wrong than such as forge a lie against Allah, or deny His Signs? But never will prosper those who sin.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010018">They serve, besides Allah, things that can hurt them not nor profit them, and they say: "These are our intercessors with Allah." Say: "Do ye indeed inform Allah of something He knows not, in the heavens or on earth?- Glory to Him! and far is He above the partners they ascribe (to Him)!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="010019">Mankind was but one nation, but differed (later). Had it not been for a Word that went forth before from thy Lord, their differences would have been settled between them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010020">They say: "Why is not a sign sent down to him from his Lord?" Say: "The Unseen is only for Allah (to know), then wait ye: I too will wait with you."</AYA>
		<AYA id="010021">When We make mankind taste of some mercy after adversity hath touched them, behold! they take to plotting against Our Signs! Say: "Swifter to plan is Allah!" Verily, Our messengers record all the plots that ye make!</AYA>
		<AYA id="010022">He it is Who enableth you to traverse through land and sea; so that ye even board ships;- they sail with them with a favorable wind, and they rejoice thereat; then comes a stormy wind and the waves come to them from all sides, and they think they are being overwhelmed: they pray unto Allah, sincerely offering (their) duty unto Him saying, "If Thou dost deliver us from this, we shall truly show our gratitude!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="010023">But when he delivereth them, behold! they transgress insolently through the earth in defiance of right! O mankind! your insolence is against your own souls,- an enjoyment of the life of the present: in the end, to Us is your return, and We shall show you the truth of all that ye did.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010024">The likeness of the life of the present is as the rain which We send down from the skies: by its mingling arises the produce of the earth- which provides food for men and animals: (It grows) till the earth is clad with its golden ornaments and is decked out (in beauty): the people to whom it belongs think they have all powers of disposal over it: There reaches it Our command by night or by day, and We make it like a harvest clean-mown, as if it had not flourished only the day before! thus do We explain the Signs in detail for those who reflect.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010025">But Allah doth call to the Home of Peace: He doth guide whom He pleaseth to a Way that is straight.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010026">To those who do right is a goodly (reward)- Yea, more (than in measure)! No darkness nor abasement shall cover their faces! They are companions of the Garden; they will abide therein (for aye)!</AYA>
		<AYA id="010027">But those who have earned evil will have a reward of like evil: ignominy will cover their (faces): No defender will they have from (the wrath of) Allah. Their faces will be covered, as it were, with pieces from the depth of the darkness of night: they are inhabitants of the Fire: they will abide therein (for aye)!</AYA>
		<AYA id="010028">One Day shall We gather them all together. Then shall We say to those who joined gods (with Us): "To your place! ye and those ye joined as 'partners'. " We shall separate them, and their "partners" shall say: "It was not us that ye worshipped!</AYA>
		<AYA id="010029">"Enough is Allah for a witness between us and you: we certainly knew nothing of your worship of us!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="010030">There will every soul see (the fruits of) the deeds it sent before: they will be brought back to Allah their rightful Lord, and their invented falsehoods will leave them in the lurch.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010031">Say: "Who is it that sustains you (in life) from the sky and from the earth? or who is it that has power over hearing and sight? And who is it that brings out the living from the dead and the dead from the living? and who is it that rules and regulates all affairs?" They will soon say, "Allah". Say, "will ye not then show piety (to Him)?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="010032">Such is Allah, your True Lord: apart from truth, what (remains) but error? How then are ye turned away?</AYA>
		<AYA id="010033">Thus is the Word of thy Lord proved true against those who rebel: Verily they will not believe.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010034">Say: "Of your 'partners', can any originate creation and repeat it?" Say: "It is Allah Who originates creation and repeats it: then how are ye deluded away (from the truth)?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="010035">Say: "Of your 'partners' is there any that can give any guidance towards Truth?" Say: "It is Allah Who gives guidance towards Truth, is then He Who gives guidance to Truth more worthy to be followed, or he who finds not guidance (himself) unless he is guided? What then is the matter with you? How judge ye?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="010036">But most of them follow nothing but conjecture: truly conjecture can be of no avail against Truth. Verily Allah is well aware of all that they do.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010037">This Quran is not such as can be produced by other than Allah. on the contrary it is a confirmation of (revelations) that went before it, and a fuller explanation of the Book - wherein there is no doubt - from the Lord of the Worlds.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010038">Or do they say, "He forged it"? Say: "Bring then a Srah like unto it, and call (to your aid) anyone you can besides Allah, if it be ye speak the truth!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="010039">Nay, they charge with falsehood that whose knowledge they cannot compass, even before the interpretation thereof hath reached them: thus did those before them make charges of falsehood: but see what was the end of those who did wrong!</AYA>
		<AYA id="010040">Of them there are some who believe therein, and some who do not: and thy Lord knoweth best those who are out for mischief.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010041">If they charge thee with falsehood, say: "My work to me, and yours to you! ye are free from responsibility for what I do, and I for what ye do!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="010042">Among them are some who (pretend to) listen to thee: But canst thou make the deaf to hear,- even though they are without understanding?</AYA>
		<AYA id="010043">And among them are some who look at thee: but canst thou guide the blind,- even though they will not see?</AYA>
		<AYA id="010044">Verily Allah will not deal unjustly with man in aught: It is man that wrongs his own soul.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010045">And on the day when He will gather them together: (It will be) as if they had tarried but an hour of a day: they will recognize each other: assuredly those will be lost who denied the meeting with Allah and refused to receive true guidance.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010046">Whether We show thee (realized in thy life-time) some part of what We promise them,- or We take thy soul (before that),- in any case, to Us is their return: ultimately Allah is witness, to all that they do.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010047">To every people (was sent) a messenger: when their apostle comes (before them), the matter will be judged between them with justice, and they will not be wronged.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010048">They say: "When will this promise come to pass,- if ye speak the truth?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="010049">Say: "I have no power over any harm or profit to myself except as Allah willeth. To every people is a term appointed: when their term is reached, not an hour can they cause delay, nor (an hour) can they advance (it in anticipation)."</AYA>
		<AYA id="010050">Say: "Do ye see,- if His punishment should come to you by night or by day,- what portion of it would the sinners wish to hasten?</AYA>
		<AYA id="010051">"Would ye then believe in it at last, when it actually cometh to pass? (It will then be said): 'Ah! now? and ye wanted (aforetime) to hasten it on!'</AYA>
		<AYA id="010052">"At length will be said to the wrong-doers: 'Taste ye the enduring punishment! ye get but the recompense of what ye earned!'"</AYA>
		<AYA id="010053">They seek to be informed by thee: "Is that true?" Say: "Aye! by my Lord! it is the very truth! and ye cannot frustrate it!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="010054">Every soul that hath sinned, if it possessed all that is on earth, would fain give it in ransom: They would declare (their) repentance when they see the Chastisement: but the judgment between them will be with justice, and no wrong will be done unto them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010055">Is it not (the case) that to Allah belongeth whatever is in the heavens and on earth? Is it not (the case) that Allah's promise is assuredly true? Yet most of them do not know.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010056">It is He Who giveth life and Who taketh it, and to Him shall ye all be brought back.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010057">O mankind! there hath come to you an admonition from your Lord and a healing for the (diseases) in your hearts,- and for those who believe, a Guidance and a Mercy.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010058">Say: "In the bounty of Allah. And in His Mercy,- in that let them rejoice": that is better than the (wealth) they hoard.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010059">Say: "See ye what things Allah hath sent down to you for sustenance? Yet ye hold forbidden some things thereof and (some things) lawful." Say: "Hath Allah indeed permitted you, or do ye forge (things) to attribute to Allah?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="010060">And what think those who forge lies against Allah, of the Day of Judgment? Verily Allah is full of Bounty to mankind, but most of them are ungrateful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010061">In whatever business thou mayest be, and whatever portion thou mayest be reciting from the Quran,- and whatever deed ye (mankind) may be doing,- We are Witnesses thereof when ye are deeply engrossed therein. Nor is hidden from thy Lord (so much as) the weight of an atom on the earth or in heaven. And not the smallest and not the greatest of these things but are recorded in a clear Record.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010062">Behold! verily on the friends of Allah there is no fear, nor shall they grieve;</AYA>
		<AYA id="010063">Those who believe and (constantly) guard against evil;-</AYA>
		<AYA id="010064">For them are Glad Tidings, in the life of the present and in the Hereafter: no change can there be in the Words of Allah. This is indeed the supreme triumph.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010065">Let not their speech grieve thee: for all power and honor belong to Allah. It is He Who heareth and knoweth (all things).</AYA>
		<AYA id="010066">Behold! verily to Allah belong all creatures, in the heavens and on earth. What do they follow who worship as His "partners" other than Allah? They follow nothing but conjecture, and they do nothing but lie.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010067">He it is that hath made you the night that ye may rest therein, and the day to make things visible (to you). Verily in this are Signs for those who listen (to His Message).</AYA>
		<AYA id="010068">They say: "Allah hath begotten a son!" - Glory be to Him! He is Self- Sufficient! His are all things in the heavens and on earth! No warrant have ye for this! Say ye about Allah what ye know not?</AYA>
		<AYA id="010069">Say: "Those who forge a lie against Allah will never prosper."</AYA>
		<AYA id="010070">A little enjoyment in this world!- and then, to Us will be their return, then shall We make them taste the severest chastisement for their disbelief.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010071">Relate to them the story of Noah. Behold! he said to his People: "O my People, if it be hard on your (mind) that I should stay (with you) and remind (you) the signs of Allah,- yet I put my trust in Allah. Get ye then an agreement about your plan and among your partners, so your plan be on to you dark and dubious. Then pass your sentence on me, and give me no respite.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010072">"But if ye turn back, (consider): no reward have I asked of you: my reward is only due from Allah, and I have been commanded to be of those who submit to Allah's Will (in Islm)."</AYA>
		<AYA id="010073">They rejected him, but We delivered him, and those with him, in the Ark, and We made them inherit (the earth), while We drowned in the flood those who rejected Our Signs. Then see what was the end of those who were warned (but heeded not)!</AYA>
		<AYA id="010074">Then after him We sent (many) messengers to their peoples: they brought them Clear Signs, but they would not believe what they had already rejected beforehand. Thus do We seal the hearts of the transgressors.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010075">Then after them sent We Moses and Aaron to Pharaoh and his chiefs with Our Signs. But they were arrogant: they were a wicked people.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010076">When the Truth did come to them from Us, they said: "This is indeed evident sorcery!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="010077">Said Moses: "Say ye (this) about the Truth when it hath (actually) reached you? Is sorcery (like) this? But sorcerers will not prosper."</AYA>
		<AYA id="010078">They said: "Hast thou come to us to turn us away from the ways we found our fathers following,- in order that thou and thy brother may have greatness in the land? But not we shall believe in you!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="010079">Said Pharaoh: "Bring me every sorcerer well versed."</AYA>
		<AYA id="010080">When the sorcerers came, Moses said to them: "Throw ye what ye (wish) to throw!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="010081">When they had had their throw, Moses said: "What ye have brought is sorcery: Allah will surely make it of no effect: for Allah prospereth not the work of those who make mischief.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010082">"And Allah by His Words doth prove and establish His Truth, however much the sinners may hate it!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="010083">But none believed in Moses except some children of his People, because of the fear of Pharaoh and his chiefs, lest they should persecute them; and certainly Pharaoh was mighty on the earth and one who transgressed all bounds.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010084">Moses said: "O my People! If ye do (really) believe in Allah, then in Him put your trust if ye submit (your will to His)."</AYA>
		<AYA id="010085">They said: "In Allah do we put out trust. Our Lord! make us not a trial for those who practice oppression;</AYA>
		<AYA id="010086">"And deliver us by Thy Mercy from those who reject (Thee)."</AYA>
		<AYA id="010087">We inspired Moses and his brother with this Message: "Provide dwellings for your people in Egypt, make your dwellings into places of worship, and establish regular prayers: and give glad tidings to those who believe!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="010088">Moses prayed: "Our Lord! Thou hast indeed bestowed on Pharaoh and his Chiefs splendor and wealth in the life of the present, and so, Our Lord, they mislead (men) from Thy Path. Deface our Lord, the features of their wealth, and send hardness to their hearts, so they will not believe until they see the grievous chastisement."</AYA>
		<AYA id="010089">Allah said: "Accepted is your prayer (O Moses and Aaron)! So stand ye straight, and follow not the path of those who know not."</AYA>
		<AYA id="010090">We took the Children of Israel across the sea: Pharaoh and his hosts followed them in insolence and spite. At length, when overwhelmed with the flood, he said: "I believe that there is no god except Him Whom the Children of Israel believe in: I am of those who submit (to Allah in Islm)."</AYA>
		<AYA id="010091">(It was said to him): "Ah now!- But a little while be f46 fore, wast thou in rebellion!- and thou didst mischief (and violence)!</AYA>
		<AYA id="010092">"This day shall We save thee in thy body, that thou mayest be a sign to those who come after thee! But verily, many among mankind are heedless of Our Signs!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="010093">We settled the Children of Israel in an honorable dwelling-place, and provided for them sustenance of the best: it was after knowledge had been granted to them, that they fell into schisms. Verily Allah will judge between them as to the schisms amongst them, on the Day of Judgment.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010094">If thou wert in doubt as to what We have revealed unto thee, then ask those who have been reading the Book from before thee: the Truth hath indeed come to thee from thy Lord: so be in no wise of those in doubt.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010095">Nor be of those who reject the Signs of Allah, or thou shalt be of those who perish.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010096">Those against whom the Word of thy Lord hath been verified would not believe-</AYA>
		<AYA id="010097">Even if every Sign was brought unto them,- until they see (for themselves) the penalty chastisement.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010098">If only there had been a single township (among those We warned), which believed,- so its faith should have profited it,- except the People of Jonah? When they believed, We removed from them the Chastisement of Ignominy in the life of the present, and permitted them to enjoy (their life) for a while.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010099">If it had been thy Lord's Will, they would all have believed,- all who are on earth! Wilt thou then compel mankind, against their will, to believe!</AYA>
		<AYA id="010100">No soul can believe, except by the will of Allah, and He will place abomination on those who will not understand.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010101">Say: "Behold all that is in the heavens and on earth"; but neither Signs nor Warners profit those who believe not.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010102">Do they then expect (any thing) but the like of (what happened in) the days of the men who passed away before them? Say: "Wait ye then: for I, too, will wait with you."</AYA>
		<AYA id="010103">In the end We deliver Our messengers and those who believe: Thus is it fitting on Our part that We should deliver those who believe!</AYA>
		<AYA id="010104">Say: "O ye men! If ye are in doubt as to my religion, (behold!) I worship not what ye worship, other than Allah! But I worship Allah - Who will take your souls (at death): I am commanded to be (in the ranks) of the Believers,</AYA>
		<AYA id="010105">"And further (thus): set thy face towards Religion with true piety, and never in any wise be of the Unbelievers;</AYA>
		<AYA id="010106">"'Nor call on any, other than Allah!- Such will neither profit thee nor hurt thee: if thou dost, behold! thou shalt certainly be of those who do wrong."</AYA>
		<AYA id="010107">If Allah do touch thee with hurt, there is none can remove it but He: if He do design some benefit for thee, there is none can keep back His favor: He causeth it to reach whomsoever of His servants He pleaseth. And He is the Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010108">Say: "O ye men! Now Truth hath reached you from your Lord! those who receive Guidance, do so for the good of their own souls; those who stray, do so to their own loss: and I am not (set) over you to arrange your affairs."</AYA>
		<AYA id="010109">Follow thou the inspiration sent unto thee, and be patient and constant, till Allah do decide: for He is the best to decide.</AYA>

		<AYA id="011001">Alif. Lm. R. (This is) a Book, with verses basic or fundamental (of established meaning), further explained in detail,- from One Who is Wise and Well-acquainted (with all things):</AYA>
		<AYA id="011002">(It teacheth) that ye should worship none but Allah. (Say): "Verily I am (sent) unto you from Him to warn and to bring glad tidings:</AYA>
		<AYA id="011003">"(And to preach thus), 'Seek ye the forgiveness of your Lord, and turn to Him in repentance; that He may grant you enjoyment, good (and true), for a term appointed, and bestow His abounding grace on all who abound in merit! But if ye turn away, then I fear for you the Chastisement of a Great Day:</AYA>
		<AYA id="011004">"To Allah is your return, and He hath power over all things.'"</AYA>
		<AYA id="011005">Behold! they fold up their hearts, that they may lie hid from Him! Ah! even when they cover themselves with their garments, He knoweth what they conceal, and what they reveal: for He knoweth well the (inmost secrets) of the hearts.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011006">There is no moving creature on earth but its sustenance dependeth on Allah: He knoweth its resting place and its temporary deposit: All is in a clear Record.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011007">He it is Who created the heavens and the earth in six Days - and His Throne was over the Waters - that He might try you, which of you is best in conduct. But if thou wert to say to them, "Ye shall indeed be raised up after death", the Unbelievers would be sure to say, "This is nothing but obvious sorcery!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="011008">If We delay the Chastisement for them for a definite term, they are sure to say, "What keeps it back?" Ah! On the day it (actually) reaches them, nothing will turn it away from them, and they will be completely encircled by that which they used to mock at!</AYA>
		<AYA id="011009">If We give man a taste of Mercy from Ourselves, and then withdraw it from him, behold! he is in despair and (falls into) ingratitude.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011010">But if We give him a taste of (Our) favors after adversity hath touched him, he is sure to say, "All evil has departed from me:" Behold! he falls into exultation and pride.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011011">Not so do those who show patience and constancy, and work righteousness; for them is forgiveness (of sins) and a great reward.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011012">Perchance thou mayest (feel the inclination) to give up a part of what is revealed unto thee, and thy heart feeleth straitened lest they say, "Why is not a treasure sent down unto him, or why does not an angel come down with him?" But thou art there only to warn! It is Allah that arrangeth all affairs!</AYA>
		<AYA id="011013">Or they may say, "He forged it," Say, "Bring ye then ten Srahs forged, like unto it, and call (to your aid) whomsoever ye can, other than Allah.- If ye speak the truth!</AYA>
		<AYA id="011014">"If then they (your false gods) answer not your (call), know ye that this Revelation is sent down (replete) with the knowledge of Allah, and that there is no god but He! will ye even then submit (to Islm)?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="011015">Those who desire the life of the present and its glitter,- to them we shall pay (the price of) their deeds therein,- without diminution.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011016">They are those for whom there is nothing in the Hereafter but the Fire: vain are the designs they frame therein, and of no effect are the deeds that they do!</AYA>
		<AYA id="011017">Can they be (like) those who accept a Clear (Sign) from their Lord, and followed by a witness from Him, and before him us the Book of Moses,- a   guide and a mercy? They believe therein; but those of the Sects that reject it,- the Fire will be their promised meeting-place. Be not then in doubt thereon: for it is the Truth from thy Lord: yet many among men do not believe!</AYA>
		<AYA id="011018">Who doth more wrong than those who forge a lie against Allah. They will be brought before their Lord, and the witnesses will say, "These are the ones who lied against their Lord! Behold! the Curse of Allah is on those who do wrong!-</AYA>
		<AYA id="011019">"Those who would hinder (men) from the path of Allah and would seek in it something crooked: these were they who denied the Hereafter!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="011020">They will not escape in earth, nor have they protectors besides Allah. Their chastisement will be doubled! They could not hear, nor they could see!</AYA>
		<AYA id="011021">They are the ones who have lost their own souls: and the (fancies) they forged have left them in the lurch!</AYA>
		<AYA id="011022">Without a doubt, these are the very ones who will lose most in the Hereafter!</AYA>
		<AYA id="011023">But those who believe and work righteousness, and humble themselves before their Lord,- They will be companions of the Gardens, to dwell therein for aye!</AYA>
		<AYA id="011024">These two kinds (of men) may be compared to the blind and deaf, and those who can see and hear well. Are they equal when compared? Will ye not then take heed?</AYA>
		<AYA id="011025">We sent Noah to his People (with a mission): "I have come to you with a Clear Warning:</AYA>
		<AYA id="011026">"That ye serve none but Allah. Verily I do fear for you the punishment of a Grievous Day."</AYA>
		<AYA id="011027">But the Chiefs of the Unbelievers among his People said: "We see (in) thee nothing but a man like ourselves: Nor do we see that any follow thee but the meanest among us, apparently: Nor do we see in you (all) any merit above us: in fact we thing ye are liars!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="011028">He said: "O my People! See ye if (it be that) I have a Clear Sign from my Lord, and that He hath sent Mercy unto me from Him, but that the Mercy hath been obscured from your sight? shall we compel you to accept it when ye are averse to it?</AYA>
		<AYA id="011029">"And O my People! I ask you for no wealth in return: my reward is from none but Allah. But I will not drive away (in contempt) those who believe: for verily they are to meet their Lord, and ye I see are the ignorant ones!</AYA>
		<AYA id="011030">"And O my People! Who would help me against Allah if I drove them away? Will ye not then take heed?</AYA>
		<AYA id="011031">"I tell you not that with me are the Treasures of Allah, nor do I know what is hidden, nor claim I to be an angel. Nor yet do I say, of those whom your eyes do despise that Allah will not grant them (all) that is good: Allah knoweth best what is in their souls: I should, if I did, indeed be a wrong- doer."</AYA>
		<AYA id="011032">They said: "O Noah! thou hast disputed with us, and (much) hast thou prolonged the dispute with us: now bring upon us what thou threatenest us with, if thou speakest the truth!?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="011033">He said: "Truly, Allah will bring it on you if He wills,- and then, ye will not be able to frustrate it!</AYA>
		<AYA id="011034">"Of no profit will be my counsel to you, much as I desire to give you (good) counsel, if it be that Allah willeth to leave you astray: He is your Lord! and to Him will ye return!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="011035">Or do they say, "He has forged it"? Say: "If I had forged it, on me were my sin! and I am free of the sins of which ye are guilty!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="011036">It was revealed to Noah: "None of thy People will believe except those who have believed already! So grieve no longer over their (evil) deeds.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011037">"But construct an Ark under Our eyes and Our inspiration, and address Me no (further) on behalf of those who are in sin: for they are about to be overwhelmed (in the Flood)."</AYA>
		<AYA id="011038">Forthwith he (starts) constructing the Ark: Every time that the Chiefs of his People passed by him, they threw ridicule on him. He said: "If ye ridicule us now, we (in our turn) can look down on you with ridicule likewise!</AYA>
		<AYA id="011039">"But soon will ye know who it is on whom will descend a chastisement that will cover them with shame,- on whom will be unloosed a chastisement lasting:"</AYA>
		<AYA id="011040">At length, behold! there came Our command, and the fountains of the earth gushed forth! We said: "Embark therein, of each kind two, male and female, and your family - except those against whom the Word has already gone forth,- and the Believers." but only a few believed with him.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011041">So he said: "Embark ye on the Ark, In the name of Allah, whether it move or be at rest! For my Lord is, be sure, Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="011042">So the Ark sailed with them on the waves (towering) like mountains, and Noah called out to his son, who had separated himself (from the rest): "O my son! embark with us, and be not with the unbelievers!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="011043">The son replied: "I will betake myself to some mountain: it will save me from the water." Noah said: "This day nothing can save, from the Command of Allah, any but those on whom He hath mercy! "And the waves came between them, and the son was among those who were drowned.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011044">Then the word went forth: "O earth! swallow up thy water, and O sky! Withhold (thy rain)!" and the water abated, and the matter was ended. The Ark rested on Mount Judi, and the word went forth: "Away with those who do wrong!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="011045">And Noah called upon his Lord, and said: "O my Lord! surely my son is of my family! and Thy promise is true, and Thou art the justest of Judges!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="011046">He said: "O Noah! He is not of thy family: for his conduct is unrighteous. So ask not of Me that of which thou hast no knowledge! I give thee counsel, lest thou become one of the ignorants!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="011047">Noah said: "O my Lord! I do seek refuge with Thee, from asking Thee for that of which I have no knowledge. And unless thou forgive me and have Mercy on me, I should indeed be among the losers!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="011048">The word came: "O Noah! Come down (from the Ark) with Peace from Us, and Blessing on thee and on some of the Peoples (who will spring) from those with thee: but (there will be other) Peoples to whom We shall grant their pleasures (for a time), but in the end will a grievous chastisement reach them from Us."</AYA>
		<AYA id="011049">Such are some of the stories of the Unseen, which We have revealed unto thee: before this, neither thou nor thy People knew them. So persevere patiently: for the End is for those who are righteous.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011050">To the d People (We sent) Hd, one of their own brethren. He said: "O my People! Worship Allah! Ye have no other god but Him. You are only forgers!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="011051">"O my People! I ask of you no reward for this (Message). My reward is from none but Him Who created me: Will ye not then understand?</AYA>
		<AYA id="011052">"And O my People! Ask forgiveness of your Lord, and turn to Him (in repentance): He will send you the skies pouring abundant rain, and add strength to your strength: so turn ye not back in sin!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="011053">They said: "O Hd! No Clear (Sign) hast thou brought us, and we are not the ones to desert our gods on thy word! Nor shall we believe in thee!</AYA>
		<AYA id="011054">"We say nothing but that (perhaps) some of our gods may have seized thee with evil." He said: "I call Allah to witness, and do ye bear witness, that I am free from the sin of ascribing, to Him,</AYA>
		<AYA id="011055">"Other gods as partners! So scheme (your worst) against me, all of you, and give me no respite.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011056">"I put my trust in Allah, My Lord and your Lord! There is not a moving creature, but He hath grasp of its fore-lock. Verily, it is my Lord that is on a straight Path.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011057">"If ye turn away,- I (at least) have conveyed the Message with which I was sent to you. My Lord will make another People to succeed you, and you will not harm Him in the least. For my Lord hath care and watch over all things."</AYA>
		<AYA id="011058">So when Our decree issued, We saved Hd and those who believed with him, by (special) Grace from Us: We saved them from a severe chastisement.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011059">Such were the d People: they rejected the Signs of their Lord and Cherisher; disobeyed His messengers; and followed the command of every powerful, obstinate transgressor.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011060">And they were pursued by a Curse in this life,- and on the Day of Judgment. Ah! Behold! for the d rejected their Lord and Cherisher! Away with d, the People of Hd!</AYA>
		<AYA id="011061">To the Thamd People (We sent) Slih, one of their own brethren. He said: "O my People! Worship Allah: ye have no other god but Him. It is He Who hath produced you from the earth and settled you therein: then ask forgiveness of Him, and turn to Him (in repentance): for my Lord is (always) near, ready to answer."</AYA>
		<AYA id="011062">They said: "O Slih! thou hast been of us! a center of our hopes hitherto! dost thou (now) forbid us the worship of what our fathers worshipped? But we are really in suspicious (disquieting) doubt as to that to which thou invitest us."</AYA>
		<AYA id="011063">He said: "O my People! do ye see? if I have a Clear (Sign) from my Lord and He hath sent Mercy unto me from Himself,- who then can help me against Allah if I were to disobey Him? What then would ye add to my (portion) but perdition?</AYA>
		<AYA id="011064">"And O my People! This she-camel of Allah is a Sign to you: leave her to feed on Allah's (free) earth, and inflict no harm on her, or a swift punishment will seize you!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="011065">But they did ham-string her. So he said: "Enjoy yourselves in your homes for three days: (then will be your ruin): (Behold) there a promise not to be belied!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="011066">When Our Decree issued, We saved Slih and those who believed with him, by (special) Grace from Us - and from the Ignominy of that day. For thy Lord - He is the Strong One, and the Mighty.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011067">The (mighty) Blast overtook the wrong-doers, and they lay prostrate in their homes before the morning,-</AYA>
		<AYA id="011068">As if they had never dwelt and flourished there. Ah! Behold! for the Thamd rejected their Lord and Cherisher! So away with the Thamd!</AYA>
		<AYA id="011069">There came Our Messengers to Abraham with glad tidings. They said, "Peace!" He answered, "Peace!" and hastened to entertain them with a roasted calf.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011070">But when he saw their hands not reaching towards the (meal), he felt some mistrust of them, and conceived a fear of them. They said: "Fear not: We have been sent against the people of Lt."</AYA>
		<AYA id="011071">And his wife was standing (there), and she laughed: But We gave her glad tidings of Isaac, and after him, of Jacob.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011072">She said: "Alas for me! shall I bear a child, seeing I am an old woman, and my husband here is an old man? That would indeed be a wonderful thing!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="011073">They said: "Dost thou wonder at Allah's decree? The grace of Allah and His blessings on you, o ye people of the house! for He is indeed worthy of all praise, full of all glory!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="011074">When fear had passed from (the mind of) Abraham and the glad tidings had reached him, he began to plead with Us for Lt's  people.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011075">For Abraham was, without doubt, forbearing (of faults), compassionate, and given to penitence.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011076">O Abraham! Seek not this. The decree of thy Lord hath gone forth: for them there cometh a chastisement that cannot be turned back!</AYA>
		<AYA id="011077">When Our Messengers came to Lt, he was grieved on their account and felt himself powerless (to protect) them. He said: "This is a distressful day."</AYA>
		<AYA id="011078">And his people came rushing towards him, and they had been long in the habit of practicing abominations. He said: "O my People! Here are my daughters: they are purer for you (if ye marry)! Now fear Allah, and cover me not with disgrace about my guests! Is there not among you a single right-minded man?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="011079">They said: "Well dost thou know we have no need of thy daughters: indeed thou knowest quite well what we want!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="011080">He said: "Would that I had power to suppress you or that I could betake myself to some powerful support."</AYA>
		<AYA id="011081">(The Messengers) said: "O Lt! We are Messengers from thy Lord! By no means shall they reach thee! now travel with thy family while yet a part of the night remains, and let not any of you look back: but thy wife (will remain behind): To her will happen what happens to the people. Morning is their time appointed: Is not the morning nigh?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="011082">When Our Decree issued, We turned (the cities) upside down, and rained down on them brimstones hard as baked clay, spread, layer on layer,-</AYA>
		<AYA id="011083">Marked as from thy Lord: Nor are they ever far from those who do wrong!</AYA>
		<AYA id="011084">To the Madyan People (We sent) Shuib, one of their own brethren: he said: "O my People! Worship Allah. Ye have no other god but Him. And give not short measure or weight: I see you in prosperity, but I fear for you the Chastisement of a Day that will compass (you) all round.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011085">"And O my People! give just measure and weight, nor withhold from the people the things that are their due: commit not evil in the land with intent to do mischief.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011086">"That which is left you by Allah is best for you, if ye (but) believed! but I am not set over you to keep watch!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="011087">They said: "O Shuib! Does thy prayer command thee that we leave off the worship which our fathers practiced, or that we leave off doing what we like with our property? truly, thou art the one that forbeareth with faults and is right- minded!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="011088">He said: "O my People! see ye whether I have a Clear (Sign) from my Lord, and He hath given me sustenance (pure and) good as from Himself? I wish not, in opposition to you, to do that which I forbid you to do. I only desire (your) betterment to the best of my power; and my success (in my task) can only come from Allah. In Him I trust, and unto Him I look.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011089">"And O my People! let not my dissent (from you) cause you to sin, lest ye suffer a fate similar to that of the people of Noah or of Hd or of Slih, nor are the people of Lt far off from you!</AYA>
		<AYA id="011090">"But ask forgiveness of your Lord, and turn unto Him (in repentance): For my Lord is indeed full of mercy and loving-kindness."</AYA>
		<AYA id="011091">They said: "O Shuib! much of what thou sayest we do not understand! In fact among us we see that thou hast no strength! Were it not for thy family, we should certainly have stoned thee! for thou hast among us no great position!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="011092">He said: "O my People! is then my family of more consideration with you than Allah? For ye cast Him away behind your backs (with contempt). But verily my Lord encompasseth on all that ye do!</AYA>
		<AYA id="011093">"And O my People! Do whatever ye can: I will do (my part): Soon will ye know who it is on whom descends the Chastisement of Ignominy; and who is a liar! and watch ye! for I too am watching with you!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="011094">When Our decree issued, We saved Shuib and those who believed with him, by (special) Mercy from Us: But the (mighty) blast did seize the wrong- doers, and they lay prostrate in their homes by the morning,-</AYA>
		<AYA id="011095">As if they had never dwelt and flourished there! So away with Madyan as were Thamd!</AYA>
		<AYA id="011096">And we sent Moses, with Our Clear (Signs) and an authority manifest,</AYA>
		<AYA id="011097">Unto Pharaoh and his Chiefs: but they followed the command of Pharaoh and the command of Pharaoh was not rightly guided.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011098">He will go before his people on the Day of Judgment, and lead them into the Fire, but woeful indeed will be the place to which they are led!</AYA>
		<AYA id="011099">And they are followed by a curse in this (life) and on the Day of Judgment: and woeful is the gift which shall be given (unto them)!</AYA>
		<AYA id="011100">These are some of the stories of communities which We relate unto thee: of them some are standing, and some have been mown down (by the sickle of time).</AYA>
		<AYA id="011101">It was not We that wronged them: they wronged their own souls: the deities, other than Allah, whom they invoked, profited them no whit when there issued the decree of thy Lord: Nor did they add aught (to their lot) but perdition!</AYA>
		<AYA id="011102">Such is the Chastisement of thy Lord when He chastises communities in the midst of their wrong: grievous, indeed, and severe is His chastisement.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011103">In that is a Sign for those who fear the Chastisement of the Hereafter: that is a Day for which mankind will be gathered together: that will be a Day of Testimony.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011104">Nor shall We delay it but for a term appointed.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011105">The day it arrives, no soul shall speak except by His leave: of those (gathered) some will be wretched and some will be blessed.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011106">Those who are wretched shall be in the Fire: There will be for them therein (nothing but) the heaving of sighs and sobs:</AYA>
		<AYA id="011107">They will dwell therein so long as the heavens and the earth endure, except as thy Lord willeth: for thy Lord is the (sure) accomplisher of what He planneth.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011108">And those who are blessed shall be in the Garden: They will dwell therein so long as the heavens and the earth endure, except as thy Lord willeth: a gift without break.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011109">Be not then in doubt as to what these men worship. They worship nothing but what their fathers worshipped before (them): but verily We shall pay them back (in full) their portion without (the least) abatement.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011110">We certainly gave the Book to Moses, but differences arose therein: had it not been that a Word had gone forth before from thy Lord, the matter would have been decided between them, but they are in suspicious doubt concerning it.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011111">And, of a surety, to all will your Lord pay back (in full the recompense) of their deeds: for He knoweth well all that they do.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011112">Therefore stand firm (in the straight Path) as thou art commanded,- thou and those who with thee turn (unto Allah.; and transgress not (from the Path): for He seeth well all that ye do.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011113">And incline not to those who do wrong, or the Fire will touch you; and ye have no protectors other than Allah, nor shall ye be helped.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011114">And establish regular prayers at the two ends of the day and at the approaches of the night: for those things, that are good remove those that are evil: that is a reminder for the mindful:</AYA>
		<AYA id="011115">And be steadfast in patience; for verily Allah will not suffer the reward of the righteous to perish.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011116">If only they had been of the generations before you, men of righteousness, who prohibited men from mischief in the earth - (but there were non) except a few among them whom We saved (from harm)? But the wrong-doers pursued the enjoyment of the good things of life which were given them, and persisted in sin.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011117">Nor would thy Lord be the One to destroy the towns unjustly while their people are righteous.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011118">If thy Lord had so willed, He could have made mankind one People: but they will not cease to differ.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011119">Except those on whom thy Lord hath bestowed His Mercy: and for this did He create them: and the Word of thy Lord shall be fulfilled: "I will fill Hell with Jinns and men all together."</AYA>
		<AYA id="011120">All that we relate to thee of the stories of the messengers,- with it We make firm thy heart: in them there cometh to thee the Truth, as well as an exhortation and a message of remembrance to those who believe.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011121">Say to those who do not believe: "Do what ever ye can: We shall do our part;</AYA>
		<AYA id="011122">"And wait ye! We too shall wait."</AYA>
		<AYA id="011123">To Allah do belong the unseen (secrets) of the heavens and the earth, and to Him goeth back every affair (for decision): then worship Him, and put thy trust in Him: and thy Lord is not unmindful of aught that ye do.</AYA>

	<SOURA id="12" name="Yusuf">
		<AYA id="012001">Alif. Lm. R. These are the Verses of the Perspicuous Book.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012002">We have sent it down as an Arabic Quran, in order that ye may learn wisdom.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012003">We do relate unto thee the most beautiful of stories, in that We reveal to thee this (portion of the) Quran: before this, thou too was among those who knew it not.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012004">Behold! Joseph said to his father: "O my father! I did see eleven stars and the sun and the moon: I saw them prostrate themselves to me!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="012005">Said (the father): "My (dear) little son! relate not thy vision to thy brothers, lest they concoct a plot against thee: for Satan is to man an avowed enemy!</AYA>
		<AYA id="012006">"Thus will thy Lord choose thee and teach thee the interpretation of stories (and events) and perfect His favor to thee and to the posterity of Jacob - even as He perfected it to thy fathers Abraham and Isaac aforetime! for Allah is full of knowledge and wisdom."</AYA>
		<AYA id="012007">Verily in Joseph and his brethren are signs for seekers (after Truth).</AYA>
		<AYA id="012008">They said: "Truly Joseph and his brother are loved more by our father than we: But we are a goodly body! Really our father is obviously wandering in error!</AYA>
		<AYA id="012009">"Slay ye Joseph or cast him out to some (unknown) land, that so the favor of your father may be given to you alone: (there will be time enough) for you to be righteous after that!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="012010">Said one of them: "Slay not Joseph, but if ye must do something, throw him down to the bottom of the well: he will be picked up by some caravan of travelers."</AYA>
		<AYA id="012011">They said: "O our father! Why dost thou not trust us with Joseph,- seeing we are indeed his sincere well-wishers?</AYA>
		<AYA id="012012">"Send him with us tomorrow to enjoy himself and play, and we shall take every care of him."</AYA>
		<AYA id="012013">(Jacob) said: "Really it saddens me that ye should take him away: I fear lest the wolf should devour him while ye attend not to him."</AYA>
		<AYA id="012014">They said: "If the wolf were to devour him while we are (so large) a party, then should we be the losers!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="012015">So they did take him away, and they all agreed to throw him down to the bottom of the well: and We put into his heart (this Message): 'Of a surety thou shalt (one day) tell them the truth of this their affair while they perceive not'</AYA>
		<AYA id="012016">Then they came to their father in the early part of the night, weeping.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012017">They said: "O our father! We went racing with one another, and left Joseph with our things; and the wolf devoured him. But thou wilt never believe us even though we tell the truth."</AYA>
		<AYA id="012018">They stained his shirt with false blood. He said: "Nay, but your minds have made up a tale (that may pass) with you, (for me) patience is most fitting: Against that which ye assert, it is Allah (alone) Whose help can be sought"...</AYA>
		<AYA id="012019">Then there came a caravan of travelers: they sent their water-carrier (for water), and he let down his bucket (into the well)...He said: "Ah there! Good news! Here is a (fine) young man!" So they concealed him as a treasure! But Allah knoweth well all that they do!</AYA>
		<AYA id="012020">The (Brethren) sold him for a miserable price, for a few dirhams counted out: in such low estimation did they hold him!</AYA>
		<AYA id="012021">The man in Egypt who bought him, said to his wife: "Make his stay ( among us) honorable: may be he will bring us much good, or we shall adopt him as a son." Thus did We establish Joseph in the land, that We might teach him the interpretation of stories (and events). And Allah hath full power and control over His affairs; but most among mankind know it not.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012022">When Joseph attained his full manhood, We gave him power and knowledge: thus do We reward those who do right.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012023">But she in whose house he was, sought to seduce him, and she fastened the doors, and said: "Now come!" He said: "Allah forbid! truly (thy husband) is my lord! he made my sojourn agreeable! truly to no good come those who do wrong!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="012024">And (with passion) did she desire him, and he would have desired her, but that he saw the evidence of his Lord: thus (did We order) that We might turn away from him (all) evil and indecent deeds: for he was one of Our servants, chosen.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012025">So they both raced each other to the door, and she tore his shirt from the back: they both found her lord near the door. She said: "What is the (fitting) punishment for one who formed an evil design against thy wife, but prison or a grievous chastisement?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="012026">He said: "It was she that sought to seduce me - from my (true) self." And one of her household saw (this) and bore witness, (thus):- "If it be that his shirt is rent from the front, then is her tale true, and he is a liar!</AYA>
		<AYA id="012027">"But if it be that his shirt is torn from the back, then is she the liar, and he is telling the truth!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="012028">So when he saw his shirt,- that it was torn at the back,- (her husband) said: "Behold! It is a snare of you women! truly, mighty is your snare!</AYA>
		<AYA id="012029">"O Joseph, pass this over! (O wife), ask forgiveness for thy sin, for truly thou hast been at fault!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="012030">Ladies said in the City: "The wife of the (great) Aziz is seeking to seduce her slave. Truly hath he inspired her with violent love: we see she is evidently going astray."</AYA>
		<AYA id="012031">When she heard of their malicious talk, she sent for them and prepared a banquet for them: she gave each of them a knife: and she said (to Joseph), "Come out before them." When they saw him, they did extol him, and (in their amazement) cut their hands: they said, "Allah preserve us! no mortal is this! this is none other than a noble angel!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="012032">She said: "There before you is the man about whom ye did blame me! I did seek to seduce him from his (true) self but he did firmly save himself guiltless! ...and now, if he doth not my bidding, he shall certainly be cast into prison, and (what is more) be of the company of the vilest!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="012033">He said: "O my Lord! the prison is dearer to my liking than that to which they invite me: unless Thou turn away their snare from me, I should feel inclined towards them and join the ranks of the ignorant."</AYA>
		<AYA id="012034">So his Lord hearkened to him (in his prayer), and turned away from him their snare: Verily He heareth and knoweth (all things).</AYA>
		<AYA id="012035">Then it occurred to them, after they had seen the Signs, (that it was best) to imprison him for a time.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012036">Now with him there came into the prison two young men. Said one of them: "I see myself (in a dream) pressing wine." Said the other: "I see myself (in a dream) carrying bread on my head, and birds are eating, thereof." "Tell us" (they said) "The truth and meaning thereof: for we see thou art one that doth good (to all)."</AYA>
		<AYA id="012037">He said: "Before any food comes (in due course) to feed either of you, I will surely reveal to you the truth and meaning of this ere it befall you: that is part of the (duty) which my Lord hath taught me. I have (I assure you) abandoned the ways of a people that believe not in Allah and that (even) deny the Hereafter.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012038">"And I follow the ways of my fathers,- Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; and never could we attribute any partners whatever to Allah: that (comes) of the grace of Allah to us and to mankind: yet most men are not grateful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012039">"O my two companions of the prison! (I ask you): are many lords differing among themselves better, or Allah he One, Supreme and Irresistible?</AYA>
		<AYA id="012040">"Whatever ye worship apart from Him is nothing but names which ye have named,- ye and your fathers,- for which Allah hath sent down no authority: the Command is for none but Allah. He hath commanded that ye worship none but Him: that is the right religion, but most men understand not...</AYA>
		<AYA id="012041">"O my two companions of the prison! As to one of you, he will pour out the wine for his lord to drink: as for the other, he will hang from the cross, and the birds will eat from off his head. (So) hath been decreed that matter whereof ye twain do inquire"...</AYA>
		<AYA id="012042">And of the two, to that one whom he considered about to be saved, he said: "Mention me to thy lord." But Satan made him forget to mention him to his lord: and (Joseph) lingered in prison a few (more) years.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012043">The king (of Egypt) said: "I do see (in a vision) seven fat kine, whom seven lean ones devour, and seven green ears of corn, and seven (others) withered. O ye chiefs! Expound to me my vision if it be that ye can interpret visions."</AYA>
		<AYA id="012044">They said: "A confused medley of dreams: and we are not skilled in the interpretation of dreams."</AYA>
		<AYA id="012045">But the man who had been released, one of the two (who had been in prison) and who now remembered him after (so long) a space of time, said: "I will tell you the truth of its interpretation: send ye me (therefore)."</AYA>
		<AYA id="012046">"O Joseph!" (he said) "O man of truth! Expound to us (the dream) of seven fat kine whom seven lean ones devour, and of seven green ears of corn and (seven) others withered: that I may return to the people, and that they may know."</AYA>
		<AYA id="012047">(Joseph) said: "For seven years shall ye diligently sow as is your wont: and the harvests that ye reap, ye shall leave them in the ear,- except a little, of which ye shall eat.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012048">"Then will come after that (period) seven dreadful (years), which will devour what ye shall have laid by in advance for them,- (all) except a little which ye shall have (specially) guarded.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012049">"Then will come after that (period) a year in which the people will have abundant water, and in which they will press (wine and oil)."</AYA>
		<AYA id="012050">So the king said: "Bring ye him unto me." But when the messenger came to him, (Joseph) said: "Go thou back to thy lord, and ask him, 'What was the matter with the ladies who cut their hands'? For my Lord is certainly well aware of their snare."</AYA>
		<AYA id="012051">(The king) said (to the ladies): "What was your affair when ye did seek to seduce Joseph?" The ladies said: "Allah preserve us! no evil know we against him!" Said the Aziz's wife: "Now is the truth manifest (to all): it was I who sought to seduce him. He is indeed of those who are (ever) true (and virtuous).</AYA>
		<AYA id="012052">"This (say I), in order that he may know that I have never been false to him in his absence, and that Allah will never guide the snare of the false ones.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012053">"Yet I do not absolve myself (of blame): the (human) soul is certainly incites to evil, unless my Lord do bestow His Mercy: but surely my Lord is Oft- forgiving, Most Merciful."</AYA>
		<AYA id="012054">So the king said: "Bring him unto me; I will take him specially to serve about my own person." Therefore when he had spoken to him, he said: "Be assured this day, thou art, of high standing with us, invested with all trust!</AYA>
		<AYA id="012055">(Joseph) said: "Set me over the store-houses of the land: I am a good keeper, knowledgeable."</AYA>
		<AYA id="012056">Thus did We give established power to Joseph in the land, to take possession therein as, when, or where he pleased. We bestow of Our Mercy on whom We please, and We suffer not, to be lost, the reward of those who do good.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012057">But verily the reward of the Hereafter is the best, for those who believe, and are constant in righteousness.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012058">Then came Joseph's brethren: they entered his presence, and he knew them, but they knew him not.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012059">And when he had furnished them forth with provisions (suitable) for them, he said: "Bring unto me a brother ye have, of the same father as yourselves, (but a different mother): see ye not that I pay out full measure, and that I do provide the best hospitality?</AYA>
		<AYA id="012060">"Now if ye bring him not to me, ye shall have no measure (of corn) from me, nor shall ye (even) come near me."</AYA>
		<AYA id="012061">They said: "We shall try to win him from his father: indeed we shall do it."</AYA>
		<AYA id="012062">And (Joseph) told his servants to put their stock-in-trade (with which they had bartered) into their saddle-bags, so they should know it only when they returned to their people, in order that they might come back.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012063">Now when they returned to their father, they said: "O our father! No more measure of grain shall we get (unless we take our brother): So send our brother with us, that we may get our measure; and we will indeed take every care of him."</AYA>
		<AYA id="012064">He said: "Shall I trust you with him with any result other than when I trusted you with his brother aforetime? But Allah is the best to take care (of him), and He is the Most Merciful of those who show mercy!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="012065">Then when they opened their baggage, they found their stock-in-trade had been returned to them. They said: "O our father! What (more) can we desire? this our stock-in-trade has been returned to us: so we shall get (more) food for our family; We shall take care of our brother; and add (at the same time) a full camel's load (of grain to our provisions). This is but a small quantity.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012066">(Jacob) said: "Never will I send him with you until ye swear a solemn oath to me, in Allah's name, that ye will be sure to bring him back to me unless ye are yourselves hemmed in (and made powerless). And when they had sworn their solemn oath, he said: "Over all that we say, be Allah the Witness and Guardian!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="012067">Further he said: "O my sons! enter not all by one gate: enter ye by different gates. Not that I can profit you aught against Allah (with my advice): None can command except Allah. On Him do I put my trust: and let all that trust put their trust on Him."</AYA>
		<AYA id="012068">And when they entered in the manner their father had enjoined, it did not profit them in the least against (the plan of) Allah. It served only to satisfy Jacob's heartfelt desire. For he was, by Our instruction, full of knowledge (and experience): but most men know not.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012069">Now when they came into Joseph's presence, he received his (full) brother to stay with him. He said (to him): "Behold! I am thy (own) brother; so grieve not at aught of their doings."</AYA>
		<AYA id="012070">At length when he had furnished them forth with provisions (suitable) for them, he put the drinking cup into his brother's saddle-bag. Then shouted out a crier: "O ye (in) the caravan! behold! ye are thieves, without doubt!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="012071">They said, turning towards them: "What is it that ye miss?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="012072">They said: "We miss the great beaker of the king; for him who produces it, is (the reward of) a camel load; I will be bound by it."</AYA>
		<AYA id="012073">(The brothers) said: "By Allah! Well ye know that we came not to make mischief in the land, and we are no thieves!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="012074">(The Egyptians) said: "What then shall be the penalty of this, if ye are (proved) to have lied?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="012075">They said: "The penalty should be that he in whose saddle-bag it is found, should be held (as bondman) to atone for the (crime). Thus it is we punish the wrong- doers!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="012076">So he began (the search) with their baggage, before (he came to) the baggage of his brother: at length he brought it out of his brother's baggage. Thus did We plan for Joseph. He could not take his brother by the law of the king except that Allah willed it (so). We raise to degrees (of wisdom) whom We please: but over all endued with knowledge is One, the All-Knowing.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012077">They said: "If he steals, there was a brother of his who did steal before (him)." But these things did Joseph keep locked in his heart, revealing not the secrets to them. He (simply) said (to himself): "Ye are the worse situated; and Allah knoweth best the truth of what ye assert!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="012078">They said: "O exalted one! Behold! he has a father, aged and venerable, (who will grieve for him); so take one of us in his place; for we see that thou art (gracious) in doing good."</AYA>
		<AYA id="012079">He said: "Allah forbid that we take other than him with whom we found our property: indeed (if we did so), we should be acting wrongfully.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012080">Now when they saw no hope of his (yielding), they held a conference in private. The leader among them said: "Know ye not that your father did take an oath from you in Allah's name, and how, before this, ye did fail in your duty with Joseph? Therefore will I not leave this land until my father permits me, or Allah judges for me; and He is the best to judge.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012081">"Turn ye back to your father, and say, 'O our father! behold! thy son committed theft! We bear witness only to what we know, and we could not well guard against the unseen!</AYA>
		<AYA id="012082">"'Ask at the town where we have been and the caravan in which we returned, and (you will find) we are indeed telling the truth.'"</AYA>
		<AYA id="012083">Jacob said: "Nay, but ye have yourselves contrived a story (good enough) for you. So patience is most fitting (for me). Maybe Allah will bring them (back) all to me (in the end). For He is indeed full of knowledge and wisdom."</AYA>
		<AYA id="012084">And he turned away from them, and said: "How great is my grief for Joseph!" And his eyes became white with sorrow, and he was suppressed with silent sorrow.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012085">They said: "By Allah. (never) wilt thou cease to remember Joseph until thou reach the last extremity of illness, or until thou die!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="012086">He said: "I only complain of my distraction and anguish to Allah, and I know from Allah that which ye know not...</AYA>
		<AYA id="012087">"O my sons! go ye and inquire about Joseph and his brother, and never give up hope of Allah's Soothing Mercy: truly no one despairs of Allah's Soothing Mercy, except those who have no faith."</AYA>
		<AYA id="012088">Then, when they came (back) into (Joseph's) presence they said: "O exalted one! distress has seized us and our family: we have (now) brought but scanty capital: so pay us full measure, (we pray thee), and treat it as charity to us: for Allah doth reward the charitable."</AYA>
		<AYA id="012089">He said: "Know ye how ye dealt with Joseph and his brother, not knowing (what ye were doing)?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="012090">They said: "Art thou indeed Joseph?" He said, "I am Joseph, and this is my brother: Allah has indeed been gracious to us (all): behold , he that is righteous and patient,- never will Allah suffer the reward to be lost, of those who do right."</AYA>
		<AYA id="012091">They said: "By Allah! Indeed has Allah preferred thee above us, and we certainly have been guilty of sin!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="012092">He said: "This day let no reproach be (cast) on you: Allah will forgive you, and He is the Most Merciful of those who show mercy!</AYA>
		<AYA id="012093">"Go with this my shirt, and cast it over the face of my father: he will come to see (clearly). Then come ye (here) to me together with all your family."</AYA>
		<AYA id="012094">When the caravan left (Egypt), their father said: "I do indeed scent the presence of Joseph: Nay, think me not a dotard."</AYA>
		<AYA id="012095">They said: "By Allah! Truly thou art in thine old wandering illusion."</AYA>
		<AYA id="012096">Then when the bearer of the good news came, He cast (the shirt) over his face, and he forthwith regained clear sight. He said: "Did I not say to you, 'I know from Allah that which ye know not?'"</AYA>
		<AYA id="012097">They said: "O our father! ask for us forgiveness for our sins, for we were truly at fault."</AYA>
		<AYA id="012098">He said: "Soon will I ask my Lord for forgiveness for you: for He is indeed Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful."</AYA>
		<AYA id="012099">Then when they entered the presence of Joseph, he provided a home for his parents with himself, and said: "Enter ye Egypt (all) in safety if it please Allah."</AYA>
		<AYA id="012100">And he raised his parents high on the throne, and they fell down in prostration, (all) before him. He said: "O my father! this is the fulfillment of my vision of old! Allah hath made it come true! He was indeed good to me when He took me out of prison and brought you (all here) out of the desert, (even) after Satan had sown enmity between me and my brothers. Verily my Lord is Gracious to whom He wills, for verily He is full of knowledge and wisdom.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012101">"O my Lord! Thou hast indeed bestowed on me some power, and taught me something of the interpretation of dreams and events,- O Thou Creator of the heavens and the earth! Thou art my Protector in this world and in the Hereafter. Take Thou my soul (at death) as one submitting to Thy Will (as a Muslim), and unite me with the righteous."</AYA>
		<AYA id="012102">Such is one of the stories of what happened unseen, which We reveal by inspiration unto thee; nor wast thou (present) with them then when they concerted their plans together in the process of weaving their plots.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012103">Yet no faith will the greater part of mankind have, however ardently thou dost desire it.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012104">And no reward dost thou ask of them for this: it is no less than a Message for all creatures.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012105">And how many Signs in the heavens and the earth do they pass by? Yet they turn (their faces) away from them!</AYA>
		<AYA id="012106">And most of them believe not in Allah without associating (other as partners) with Him!</AYA>
		<AYA id="012107">Do they then feel secure from the coming against them of the covering veil of the wrath of Allah,- or of the coming against them of the (final) Hour all of a sudden while they perceive not?</AYA>
		<AYA id="012108">Say thou: "This is my Way: I do invite unto Allah,- with certain knowledge, - I and whoever follows me. Glory to Allah, and never will I join gods with Allah!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="012109">Nor did We send before thee messengers any but men, whom We did inspire,- (men) from the people of the towns. Do they not travel through the earth, and see what was the end of those before them? But the home of the Hereafter is best, for those who do right. Will ye not then understand?</AYA>
		<AYA id="012110">(Respite will be granted) until, when the messengers give up hope (of their people) and (com 289 e to) think that they were treated as liars, there reaches them Our help, and those whom We will are delivered into safety. But never will be warded off our punishment from those who are in sin.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012111">There is, in their stories, instruction for men endued with understanding. It is not a tale invented, but a confirmation of what went before it,- a detailed exposition of all things, and a Guide and a Mercy to any such as believe.</AYA>

	<SOURA id="13" name="The Thunder">
		<AYA id="013001">Alif. Lm. Mm. R. These are the verses of the Book: that which hath been revealed unto thee from thy Lord is the Truth; but most men believe not.</AYA>
		<AYA id="013002">Allah is He Who raised the heavens without any pillars that ye can see; then He established Himself on the Throne; He has subjected the sun and the moon! Each one runs (its course) for a term appointed. He doth regulate all affairs, explaining the signs in detail, that ye may believe with certainty in the meeting with your Lord.</AYA>
		<AYA id="013003">And it is He Who spread out the earth, and set thereon mountains standing firm and (flowing) rivers: and fruit of every kind He made in pairs, two and two: He draweth the night as a veil o'er the Day. Behold, verily in these things there are Signs for those who consider!</AYA>
		<AYA id="013004">And in the earth are tracts (diverse though) neighboring, and gardens of vines and fields sown with corn, and palm trees - growing out of single roots or otherwise: watered with the same water, yet some of them We make more excellent than others to eat. Behold, verily in these things there are Signs for those who understand!</AYA>
		<AYA id="013005">If thou dost marvel (at their want of faith), strange is their saying: "When we are (actually) dust, shall we indeed then be in a creation renewed?" They are those who deny their Lord! They are those round whose necks will be yokes (of servitude): they will be Companions of the Fire, to dwell therein (for aye)!</AYA>
		<AYA id="013006">They ask thee to hasten on the evil in preference to the good: Yet have come to pass, before them, (many) exemplary punishments! But verily thy Lord is full of forgiveness for mankind for their wrong-doing, and verily thy Lord is (also) strict in punishment.</AYA>
		<AYA id="013007">And the Unbelievers say: "Why is not a sign sent down to him from his Lord?" But thou art truly a warner, and to every people a guide.</AYA>
		<AYA id="013008">Allah doth know what every female (womb) doth bear, by how much the wombs fall short (of their time or number) or do exceed. Every single thing is with Him, in (due) proportion.</AYA>
		<AYA id="013009">He knoweth the Unseen and that which is open: He is the Great, the Most High.</AYA>
		<AYA id="013010">It is the same (to Him) whether any of you conceal his speech or declare it openly; whether he lie hid by night or walk forth freely by day.</AYA>
		<AYA id="013011">For each (such person) there are (angels) in succession, before and behind him: They guard him by command of Allah. Verily never will Allah change the condition of a people until they change what is in themselves. But when (once) Allah willeth a people's punishment, there can be no turning it back, nor will they find, besides Him, any to protect.</AYA>
		<AYA id="013012">It is He Who doth show you the lightning, by way both of fear and of hope: It is He Who doth raise up the clouds, heavy with (fertilizing) rain!</AYA>
		<AYA id="013013">Nay, thunder repeateth His praises, and so do the angels, with awe: He flingeth the loud-voiced thunder-bolts, and therewith He striketh whomsoever He will; yet these (are the men) the while they are disputing about Allah, He is Mighty in Power.</AYA>
		<AYA id="013014">To Him is due the true prayer : any others that they call upon besides Him hear them no more than if they were to stretch forth their hands for water to reach their mouths but it reaches them not: for the prayer of those without Faith is nothing but vain prayer.</AYA>
		<AYA id="013015">Whatever beings there are in the heavens and the earth do prostrate themselves to Allah,- with good-will or in spite of themselves: so do their shadows in the morning and evenings.</AYA>
		<AYA id="013016">Say: "Who is the Lord and Sustainer of the heavens and the earth?" Say: "(It is) Allah." Say: "Do ye then take (for worship) protectors other than Him, such as have no power either for good or for harm to themselves?" Say: "Are the blind equal with those who see? Or the depths of darkness equal with light?" Or do they assign to Allah partners who have created (anything) as He has created, so that the creation seemed to them similar? Say: "Allah is the Creator of all things: He is the One, the Supreme and Irresistible."</AYA>
		<AYA id="013017">He sends down water from the skies, and the channels flow, each according to its measure: But the torrent bears away the foam that mounts up to the surface. Even so, from that (ore) which they heat in the fire, to make ornaments or utensils therewith, there is a scum likewise. Thus doth Allah (by parables) show forth Truth and Falsehood. For the scum disappears like forth cast out; while that which is for the good of mankind remains on the earth. Thus doth Allah set forth parables.</AYA>
		<AYA id="013018">For those who respond to their Lord, are (all) Good Things. But those who respond not to Him,- even if they had all that is in the heavens and on earth, and as much more, (in vain) would they offer it for ransom. For them will the reckoning be terrible: their abode will be Hell,- what a bed of misery!</AYA>
		<AYA id="013019">Is then one who doth know that that which hath been revealed unto thee from thy Lord is the Truth, like one who is blind? It is those who are endued with understanding that receive admonition;-</AYA>
		<AYA id="013020">Those who fulfill the Covenant of Allah and fail not in their plighted word;</AYA>
		<AYA id="013021">Those who join together those things which Allah hath commanded to be joined, hold their Lord in awe, and fear the terrible reckoning;</AYA>
		<AYA id="013022">Those who patiently persevere, seeking the countenance of their Lord; establish regular prayers; spend, out of (the gifts) We have bestowed for their sustenance, secretly and openly; and turn off evil with good: for such there is the final attainment of the (eternal) home,-</AYA>
		<AYA id="013023">Gardens of perpetual bliss: they shall enter there, as well as the righteous among their fathers, their spouses, and their offspring: and angels shall enter unto them from every gate (with the salutation):</AYA>
		<AYA id="013024">"Peace unto you for that ye persevered in patience! Now how excellent is the final Home!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="013025">But those who break the Covenant of Allah, after having plighted their word thereto, and cut asunder those things which Allah has commanded to be joined, and work mischief in the land;- on them is the Curse; for them is the terrible Home!</AYA>
		<AYA id="013026">Allah doth enlarge, or grant by (strict) measure, the sustenance (which He giveth) to whomso He pleaseth. (The worldly) rejoice in the life of this world: But the life of this world is but little comfort in the Hereafter.</AYA>
		<AYA id="013027">The Unbelievers say: "Why is not a Sign sent down to him from his Lord?" Say: "Truly Allah leaveth, to stray, whom He will; But He guideth to Himself those who turn to Him in penitence,-</AYA>
		<AYA id="013028">"Those who believe, and whose hearts find satisfaction in the remembrance of Allah; for without doubt in the remembrance of Allah do hearts find satisfaction.</AYA>
		<AYA id="013029">"For those who believe and work righteousness, is (every) blessedness, and a beautiful place of (final) return."</AYA>
		<AYA id="013030">Thus have We sent thee amongst a People before whom (long since) have (other) Peoples (gone and) passed away; in order that thou mightest rehearse unto them what We send down unto thee by inspiration; yet do they reject (Him), the Most Gracious! Say: "He is my Lord! There is no god but He! On Him is my trust, and to Him do I turn!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="013031">If there were a Quran with which mountains were moved, or the earth were cloven asunder, or the dead were made to speak, (this would be the one!) But, truly, the Command is with Allah in all things! Do not the Believers know, that, had Allah (so) willed, He could have guided all mankind (to the Right)? But the Unbelievers,- never will disaster cease to seize them for their (ill) deeds, or to settle close to their homes, until the promise of Allah come to pass, for, verily, Allah will not fail in His promise.</AYA>
		<AYA id="013032">Mocked were (many) messengers before thee: but I granted respite to the Unbelievers, and finally I punished them: then how (terrible) was my requital!</AYA>
		<AYA id="013033">Is then He Who standeth over every soul (and knoweth) all that it doth, (like any others)? And yet they ascribe partners to Allah. Say: "But name them! Is it that ye will inform Him of something He knoweth not on earth, or is it (just) a show of words?" Nay! to those who believe not, their devising seems pleasing, but they are kept back (thereby) from the Path. And those whom Allah leads astray, no one can guide.</AYA>
		<AYA id="013034">For them is a penalty in the life of this world, but harder, truly, is the chastisement of the Hereafter: and defender have they none against Allah.</AYA>
		<AYA id="013035">The parable of the Garden which the righteous are promised!- beneath it flow rivers: perpetual is the fruits thereof and the shade therein: such is the end of the Righteous; and the end of Unbelievers in the Fire.</AYA>
		<AYA id="013036">Those to whom We have given the Book rejoice at what hath been revealed unto thee: but there are among the clans those who reject a part thereof. Say: "I am commanded to worship Allah, and not to join partners with Him. Unto Him do I call, and unto Him is my return."</AYA>
		<AYA id="013037">Thus have We revealed it to be a judgment of authority in Arabic. Wert thou to follow their (vain) desires after the knowledge which hath reached thee, then wouldst thou find neither protector nor defender against Allah.</AYA>
		<AYA id="013038">We did send messengers before thee, and appointed for them wives and children: and it was never the part of a messenger to bring a Sign except as Allah permitted (or commanded). For each period is an appointment.</AYA>

		<AYA id="014001">Alif. Lm. R. A Book which We have revealed unto thee, in order that thou mightest lead mankind out of the depths of darkness into light - by the leave of their Lord - to the Way of (Him) the Exalted in power, worthy of all praise!-</AYA>
		<AYA id="014002">Of Allah, to Whom do belong all things in the heavens and on earth! But alas for the Unbelievers for a terrible chastisement (their Unfaith will bring them)!-</AYA>
		<AYA id="014003">Those who prefer the life of this world to the Hereafter, who hinder (men) from the Path of Allah and seek to make it something crooked: they are astray by a long distance.</AYA>
		<AYA id="014004">We sent not a messenger except (to teach) in the language of his (own) people, in order to make (things) clear to them. So Allah leads astray those whom He pleases and guides whom He pleases: and He is Exalted in power, full of Wisdom.</AYA>
		<AYA id="014005">We sent Moses with Our Signs (and the command) "Bring out thy people from the depths of darkness into light, and remind them of the Days of Allah." Verily in this there are Signs for such as are firmly patient and constant,- grateful and appreciative.</AYA>
		<AYA id="014006">Remember! Moses said to his people: "Call to mind the favor of Allah to you when He delivered you from the people of Pharaoh: they set you hard tasks and punishments, slaughtered your sons, and let your women-folk live: therein was a tremendous trial from your Lord."</AYA>
		<AYA id="014007">And remember! your Lord caused to be declared (publicly): "If ye are grateful, I will add more (favors) unto you; but if ye show ingratitude, truly My punishment is terrible indeed."</AYA>
		<AYA id="014008">And Moses said: "If ye show ingratitude, ye and all on earth together, yet is Allah free of all wants, worthy of all praise."</AYA>
		<AYA id="014009">Has not the story reached you, (O people!), of those who (went) before you? - of the people of Noah, and d, and Thamd? - And of those who (came) after them? None knows them but Allah. To them came messengers with Clear (Signs); but they put their hands up to their mouths, and said: "We do deny (the mission) on which ye have been sent, and we are really in suspicious (disquieting) doubt as to that to which ye invite us."</AYA>
		<AYA id="014010">Their messengers said: "Is there a doubt about Allah, The Creator of the heavens and the earth? It is He Who invites you, in order that He may forgive you your sins and give you respite for a term appointed!" They said: "Ah! ye are no more than human, like ourselves! Ye wish to turn us away from what our fathers used to worship: then bring us some clear authority."</AYA>
		<AYA id="014011">Their messengers said to them: "True, we are human like yourselves, but Allah doth grant His grace to such of His servants as He pleases. It is not for us to bring you an authority except as Allah permits. And on Allah let all men of faith put their trust.</AYA>
		<AYA id="014012">"Why we should not put our trust on Allah? Indeed He Has guided us to the Ways we (follow). We shall certainly bear with patience all the hurt you may cause us. For those who put their trust should put their trust on Allah."</AYA>
		<AYA id="014013">And the Unbelievers said to their messengers: "Be sure we shall drive you out of our land, or ye shall return to our religion." But their Lord inspired (this Message) to them: "Verily We shall cause the wrong-doers to perish!</AYA>
		<AYA id="014014">"And verily We shall cause you to abide in the land, and succeed them. This for such as fear the Time when they shall stand before My tribunal,- such as fear the punishment."</AYA>
		<AYA id="014015">But they sought victory and decision (there and then), and frustration was the lot of every powerful obstinate transgressor.</AYA>
		<AYA id="014016">In front of such a one is Hell, and he is given, for drink, boiling fetid water.</AYA>
		<AYA id="014017">In gulps will he sip it, but never will he be near swallowing it down his throat: death will come to him from every quarter, yet will he not die: and in front of him will be a chastisement unrelenting.</AYA>
		<AYA id="014018">The parable of those who reject their Lord is that their works are as ashes, on which the wind blows furiously on a tempestuous day: No power have they over aught that they have earned: that is the straying far, far (from the goal).</AYA>
		<AYA id="014019">Seest thou not that Allah created the heavens and the earth in Truth? If He so will, He can remove you and put (in your place) a new creation?</AYA>
		<AYA id="014020">Nor is that for Allah any great matter.</AYA>
		<AYA id="014021">They will all be marshaled before Allah together: then will the weak say to those who were arrogant, "For us, we but followed you; can ye then avail us to all against the wrath of Allah?" They will reply, "If we had received the Guidance of Allah, we should have given it to you: to us it makes no difference (now) whether we rage, or bear (these torments) with patience: for ourselves there is no way of escape."</AYA>
		<AYA id="014022">And Satan will say when the matter is decided: "It was Allah Who gave you a promise of Truth: I too promised, but I failed in my promise to you. I had no authority over you except to call you but ye listened to me: then reproach not me, but reproach your own souls. I cannot listen to your cries, nor can ye listen to mine. I reject your former act in associating me with Allah. For wrong-doers there must be a grievous chastisement."</AYA>
		<AYA id="014023">But those who believe and work righteousness will be admitted to Gardens beneath which rivers flow,- to dwell therein for aye with the leave of their Lord. Their greeting therein will be: "Peace!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="014024">Seest thou not how Allah sets forth a parable? - A goodly Word like a goodly tree, whose root is firmly fixed, and its branches (reach) to the heavens,-</AYA>
		<AYA id="014025">It brings forth its fruit at all times, by the leave of its Lord. So Allah sets forth parables for men, in order that they may receive admonition.</AYA>
		<AYA id="014026">And the parable of an evil Word is that of an evil tree: It is torn up by the root from the surface of the earth: it has no stability.</AYA>
		<AYA id="014027">Allah will establish in strength those who believe, with the Word that stands firm, in this world and in the Hereafter; but Allah will leave, to stray, those who do wrong: Allah doeth what He willeth.</AYA>
		<AYA id="014028">Hast thou not turned thy thought to those who have changed the favor of Allah, with ingratitude, and caused their people to descend to the House of Perdition?-</AYA>
		<AYA id="014029">Into Hell? They will burn therein,- an evil place to stay in!</AYA>
		<AYA id="014030">And they set up (idols) as equal to Allah, to mislead (men) from His Path! Say: "Enjoy (your brief power)! But verily ye are making straightway for Hell!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="014031">Speak to my servants who have believed, that they may establish regular prayers, and spend (in charity) out of the sustenance We have given them, secretly and openly, before the coming of a Day in which there will be neither mutual bargaining nor befriending.</AYA>
		<AYA id="014032">It is Allah Who hath created the heavens and the earth and sendeth down rain from the skies, and with it bringeth out fruits wherewith to feed you; it is He Who hath made the ships subject to you, that they may sail through the sea by His command; and the river f65 s (also) hath He made subject to you.</AYA>
		<AYA id="014033">And He hath made subject to you the sun and the moon, both diligently pursuing their courses; and the night and the day hath He (also) made subject to you.</AYA>
		<AYA id="014034">And He giveth you of all that ye ask for. But if ye count the favors of Allah, never will ye be able to number them. Verily, man is given up to injustice and ingratitude.</AYA>
		<AYA id="014035">Remember Abraham said: "O my Lord! make this city one of peace and security: and preserve me and my sons from worshipping idols.</AYA>
		<AYA id="014036">"O my Lord! they have indeed led astray many among mankind; He then who follows my (ways) is of me, and he that disobeys me,- but Thou art indeed Oft- forgiving, Most Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="014037">"O our Lord! I have made some of my offspring to dwell in a valley without cultivation, by Thy Sacred House; in order, O our Lord, that they may establish regular Prayer: so fill the hearts of some among men with love towards them, and feed them with fruits: so that they may give thanks.</AYA>
		<AYA id="014038">"O our Lord! truly Thou dost know what we conceal and what we reveal: for nothing whatever is hidden from Allah, whether on earth or in heaven.</AYA>
		<AYA id="014039">"Praise be to Allah, Who hath granted unto me in old age Ismail and Isaac: for truly my Lord is He, the Hearer of Prayer!</AYA>
		<AYA id="014040">"O my Lord! make me one who establishes regular Prayer, and also (raise such) among my offspring, O our Lord!, and accept Thou my Prayer.</AYA>
		<AYA id="014041">"O our Lord! cover (us) with Thy Forgiveness - me, my parents, and (all) Believers, on the Day that the Reckoning will be established!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="014042">Think not that Allah doth not heed the deeds of those who do wrong. He but giveth them respite against a Day when the eyes will fixedly stare in horror,-</AYA>
		<AYA id="014043">They running forward with necks outstretched, their heads uplifted, their gaze returning not towards them, and their hearts a (gaping) void!</AYA>
		<AYA id="014044">So warn mankind of the Day when the Wrath will reach them: then will the wrong-doers say: "Our Lord! respite us (if only) for a short term: we will answer Thy call, and follow the messenger!" "What! were ye not wont to swear aforetime that ye should suffer no decline?</AYA>
		<AYA id="014045">"And ye dwelt in the dwellings of men who wronged themselves. Ye were clearly shown how We dealt with them; and We put forth (many) parables in your behoof!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="014046">Mighty indeed were the plots which they made, but their plots were (well) within the sight of Allah, even though they were such as to shake the hills!</AYA>
		<AYA id="014047">Never think that Allah would fail His messengers in His promise: for Allah is Exalted in power, - the Lord of Retribution.</AYA>
		<AYA id="014048">One day the earth will be changed to a different earth, and so will be the heavens, and (men) will be marshaled forth, before Allah, the One, the Irresistible;</AYA>
		<AYA id="014049">And thou wilt see the sinners that day bound together in fetters;-</AYA>
		<AYA id="014050">Their garments of liquid pitch, and their faces covered with Fire;</AYA>
		<AYA id="014051">That Allah may requite each soul according to its deserts; and verily Allah is swift in calling to account.</AYA>
		<AYA id="014052">Here is a Message for mankind: that they may take warning therefrom, and let them know that He is (no other than) One Allah. let men of understanding take heed.</AYA>

		<AYA id="015004">Never did We destroy a population that had not a term decreed and assigned beforehand.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015005">Neither can a people anticipate its term, nor delay it.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015006">They say: "O thou to whom the Message is being revealed! truly thou art mad (or possessed)!</AYA>
		<AYA id="015007">"Why bringest thou not angels to us if it be that thou hast the Truth?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="015008">We send not the angels down except for just cause: if they came (to the ungodly), behold! no respite would they have!</AYA>
		<AYA id="015009">We have, without doubt, sent down the Message; and We will assuredly guard it (from corruption).</AYA>
		<AYA id="015010">We did send messengers before thee amongst the sects of old:</AYA>
		<AYA id="015011">But never came a messenger to them but they mocked him.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015012">Even so do we let it creep into the hearts of the sinners -</AYA>
		<AYA id="015013">They do not believe in the Message, such has been the way of those who went before them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015014">Even if We opened out to them a gate from heaven, and they were to continue (all day) ascending therein,</AYA>
		<AYA id="015015">They would only say: "Our eyes have been intoxicated: Nay, we have been bewitched by sorcery."</AYA>
		<AYA id="015016">It is We Who have set out constellations signs in the heavens, and made them fair-seeming to (all) beholders;</AYA>
		<AYA id="015017">And (moreover) We have guarded them from every accursed Satan.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015018">But any that gains a hearing by stealth, is pursued by a fiery comet, bright (to see).</AYA>
		<AYA id="015019">And the earth We have spread out (like a carpet); set thereon mountains firm and immovable; and produced therein all kinds of things in due balance.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015020">And We have provided therein means of subsistence,- for you and for those for whose sustenance ye are not responsible.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015021">And there is not a thing but its (sources and) treasures (inexhaustible) are with Us; but We only send down thereof in due and ascertainable measures.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015022">And We send the fecundating winds, then cause the rain to descend from the sky, therewith providing you with water (in abundance), though ye are not the guardians of its stores.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015023">And verily, it is We Who give life, and Who give death: it is We Who remain inheritors (after all else passes away).</AYA>
		<AYA id="015024">To Us are known those of you who hasten forward, and those who lag behind.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015025">Assuredly it is thy Lord Who will gather them together: for He is Perfect in Wisdom and Knowledge.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015026">We created man from sounding clay, from mud molded into shape;</AYA>
		<AYA id="015027">And the Jinn race, We had created before, from the fire of a scorching wind.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015028">Behold! thy Lord said to the angels: "I am about to create man, from sounding clay from mud molded into shape;</AYA>

		<AYA id="015034">(Allah) said: "Then get thee out from here; for thou art rejected, accursed.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015035">"And the Curse shall be on thee till the day of Judgment."</AYA>
		<AYA id="015036">(Iblis) said: "O my Lord! give me then respite till the Day the (dead) are raised."</AYA>

		<AYA id="015049">Tell My servants that I am indeed the Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful;</AYA>
		<AYA id="015050">And that My Chastisement will be indeed the most grievous Chastisement.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015051">Tell them about the guests of Abraham.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015052">When they entered his presence and said, "Peace!" He said, "We feel afraid of you!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="015053">They said: "Fear not! We give thee glad tidings of a son endowed with knowledge."</AYA>
		<AYA id="015054">He said: "Do ye give me glad tidings even though old age has seized me? Of what, then, is your good news?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="015055">They said: "We give thee glad tidings in truth: be not then in despair!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="015056">He said: "And who despairs of the mercy of his Lord, but such as go astray?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="015057">Abraham said: "What then is the business on which ye (have come), O ye messengers (of Allah)?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="015058">They said: "We have been sent to a people (deep) in sin,</AYA>
		<AYA id="015059">"Excepting the adherents of Lt: them We are certainly (charged) to save (from harm),- All -</AYA>
		<AYA id="015060">"Except his wife, who, We have ascertained, will be among those who will lag behind."</AYA>
		<AYA id="015061">At length when the messengers arrived among the adherents of Lt,</AYA>
		<AYA id="015062">He said: "Ye appear to be uncommon folk."</AYA>
		<AYA id="015063">They said: "Yea, we have come to thee to accomplish that of which they doubt.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015064">"We have come to thee with the truth, and assuredly we tell the truth.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015065">"Then travel by night with thy household, when a portion of the night (yet remains), and do thou go behind them: let no one amongst you look back, but pass on whithe f64 r ye are ordered."</AYA>
		<AYA id="015066">And We made known this decree to him, that the last remnants of those (sinners) should be cut off by the morning.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015067">The inhabitants of the City came in (mad) joy (at news of the young men).</AYA>
		<AYA id="015068">Lt said: "These are my guests: disgrace me not:</AYA>

		<AYA id="015070">They said: "Did we not forbid thee (to speak) for all and sundry?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="015071">He said: "There are my daughters (to marry), if ye must act (so)."</AYA>
		<AYA id="015072">Verily, by thy life (O Prophet), in their wild intoxication, they wander in distraction, to and fro.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015073">But the (mighty) Blast overtook them at sunrise,</AYA>
		<AYA id="015074">And We turned (the cities) upside down, and rained down on them brimstones hard as baked clay.</AYA>

		<AYA id="015078">And the Companions of the Wood were also wrong-doers;</AYA>
		<AYA id="015079">So We exacted retribution from them. They were both on an open highway, plain to see.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015080">The Companions of the Rocky Tract also rejected the messengers:</AYA>
		<AYA id="015081">We sent them Our Sings, but they persisted in turning away from them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015082">Out of the mountains did they hew (their) edifices, (feeling themselves) secure.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015083">But the (mighty) Blast seized them of a morning,</AYA>
		<AYA id="015084">And of no avail to them was all that they did (with such art and care)!</AYA>
		<AYA id="015085">We created not the heavens, the earth, and all between them, but for just ends. And the Hour is surely coming (when this will be manifest). So overlook (any human faults) with gracious forgiveness.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015086">For verily it is thy Lord Who is the All-Creator, knowing all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015087">And We have bestowed upon thee the Seven Oft-repeated (verses) and the Grand Quran.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015088">Strain not thine eyes. (Wistfully) at what We have bestowed on certain classes of them, nor grieve over them: but lower thy wing (in gentleness) to the believers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015089">And say: "I am indeed he that warneth openly and without ambiguity,"-</AYA>
		<AYA id="015090">(Of just such wrath) as We sent down on those who divided (Scripture into arbitrary parts),-</AYA>
		<AYA id="015091">(So also on such) as have made Quran into shreds (as they please).</AYA>
		<AYA id="015092">Therefore, by thy Lord, We will, of a surety, call them to account,</AYA>
		<AYA id="015093">For all their deeds.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015094">Therefore expound openly what thou art commanded, and turn away from those who join false gods with Allah.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015095">For sufficient are We unto thee against those who scoff,-</AYA>
		<AYA id="015096">Those who adopt, with Allah, another god: but soon will they come to know.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015097">We do indeed know how thy heart is distressed at what they say.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015098">But celebrate the praises of thy Lord, and be of those who prostrate themselves in adoration.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015099">And serve thy Lord until there come unto thee the Hour that is Certain.</AYA>

		<AYA id="016021">(They are things) dead, lifeless: nor do they know when they will be raised up.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016022">Your God is One God. as to those who believe not in the Hereafter, their hearts refuse to know, and they are arrogant.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016023">Undoubtedly Allah doth know what they conceal, and what they reveal: verily He loveth not the arrogant.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016024">When it is said to them, "What is it that your Lord has revealed?" they say, "Tales of the ancients!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="016025">That they may, on the Day of Judgment, their own burdens in full, and also (something) of the burdens of those without knowledge, whom they misled. Alas, how grievous the burdens they will bear!</AYA>
		<AYA id="016026">Those before them did also plot (against Allah's Way): but Allah took their structures from their foundations, and the roof fell down on them from above; and the Wrath seized them from directions they did not perceive.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016027">Then, on the Day of Judgment, He will cover them with shame, and say: "Where are My 'partners' concerning whom ye used to dispute (with the godly)?" Those endued with knowledge will say: "This Day, indeed, are the Unbelievers covered with shame and misery,-</AYA>
		<AYA id="016028">"(Namely) those whose lives the angels take in a state of wrong-doing to their own souls." Then would they offer submission (with the pretense), "We did no evil (knowingly)." (The angels will reply), "Nay, but verily Allah knoweth all that ye did;</AYA>
		<AYA id="016029">"So enter the gates of Hell, to dwell therein. Thus evil indeed is the abode of the arrogant."</AYA>
		<AYA id="016030">To the righteous (when) it is said, "What is it that your Lord has revealed?" they say, "All that is good." To those who do good, there is good in this world, and the Home of the Hereafter is even better and excellent indeed is the Home of the righteous,-</AYA>
		<AYA id="016031">Gardens of Eternity which they will enter: beneath them flow (pleasant) rivers: they will have therein all that they wish: thus doth Allah reward the righteous,-</AYA>
		<AYA id="016032">(Namely) those whose lives the angels take in a state of purity, saying (to them), "Peace be on you; enter ye the Garden, because of (the good) which ye did (in the world)."</AYA>
		<AYA id="016033">Do the (ungodly) wait but for the angels come to them, or there comes the Command of thy Lord (for their doom)? So did those who went before them. But Allah wronged them not: nay, they wronged their own souls.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016034">But the evil results of their deeds overtook them, and that very (Wrath) at which they had scoffed hemmed them in.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016035">The worshippers of false gods say: "If Allah had so willed, we should not have worshipped aught but Him - neither we nor our fathers,- nor should we have prescribed prohibitions other than His." So did those who went before them. But what is the mission of messengers but to preach the Clear Message?</AYA>
		<AYA id="016036">For We assuredly sent amongst every People a Messengers, (with the Command), "Serve Allah, and eschew Evil": of the People were some whom Allah guided, and some on whom error became inevitably (established). So travel through the earth, and see what was the end of those who denied (the Truth).</AYA>
		<AYA id="016037">If thou art anxious for their guidance, yet Allah guideth not such as He leaves to stray, and there is none to help them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016038">They swear their strongest oaths by Allah, that Allah will not raise up those who die: Nay, but it is a promise (binding) on Him in truth: but most among mankind know it not.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016039">(They must be raised up), in order that He may manifest to them the truth of that wherein they differ, and that the rejecters of Truth may realize that they were liars.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016040">For to anything which We have willed, We but say, "Be", and it is.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016041">To those who leave their homes in the Cause of Allah, after suffering oppression,- We will assuredly give a goodly home in this world; but truly the reward of the Hereafter will be greater. If they only realized (this)!</AYA>
		<AYA id="016042">(They are) those who persevere in patience, and put their trust on their Lord.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016043">And before thee We sent none but men, to whom We granted inspiration: if ye realize this not, ask of those who possess the Message.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016044">(We sent them) with Clear Signs and Scriptures; and We have sent down unto thee (also) the Message; that thou mayest explain clearly to men what is sent for them, and that they may give thought.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016045">Do then those who devise evil (plots) feel secure that Allah will not cause the earth to swallow them up, or that the Wrath will not seize them from directions they little perceive?-</AYA>
		<AYA id="016046">Or that He may not call them to account in the midst of their goings to and fro, without a chance of their frustrating Him?-</AYA>
		<AYA id="016047">Or that He may not call them to account by a process of slow wastage - for thy Lord is indeed full of kindness and mercy.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016048">Do they not look at Allah's creation, among things,- How their shadows turn round, from the right and the left, prostrating themselves to Allah, and that in the humblest manner?</AYA>
		<AYA id="016049">And to Allah doth prostrate all that is in the heavens and on earth, whether moving creatures or the angels: for none are arrogant (before their Lord).</AYA>
		<AYA id="016050">They all fear their Lord, high above them, and they do all that they are commanded.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016051">Allah has said: "Take not (for worship) two gods: for He is just One God: then fear Me (and Me alone)."</AYA>
		<AYA id="016052">To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and on earth, and to Him is the religion always: then will ye fear other than Allah?</AYA>
		<AYA id="016053">And ye have no good thing but is from Allah: and moreover, when ye are touched by distress, unto Him ye cry with groans;</AYA>
		<AYA id="016054">Yet, when He removes the distress from you, behold! some of you turn to other gods to join with their Lord-</AYA>
		<AYA id="016055">To show their ingratitude for the favors We have bestowed on them! then enjoy (your brief day): but soon will ye know (your folly)!</AYA>
		<AYA id="016056">And they (even) assign, to things they do not know, a portion out of that which We have bestowed for their sustenance! By Allah, ye shall certainly be called to account for your false inventions.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016057">And they assign daughters for Allah. - Glory be to Him! - and for themselves what they desire!</AYA>
		<AYA id="016058">When news is brought to one of them, of (the birth of) a female (child), his face darkens, and he is filled with inward grief!</AYA>
		<AYA id="016059">With shame does he hide himself from his people, because of the bad news he has had! Shall he retain it on (sufferance and) contempt, or bury it in the dust? Ah! what an evil (choice) they decide on?</AYA>
		<AYA id="016060">To those who believe not in the Hereafter, applies the similitude of evil: to Allah applies the highest similitude: for He is the Exalted in Power, full of Wisdom.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016061">If Allah were to punish men for their wrong-doing, He would not leave, on the (earth), a single living creature: but He gives them respite for a stated Term: When their Term expires, they would not be able to delay (the punishment) for a single hour, just as they would not be able to anticipate it (for a single hour).</AYA>
		<AYA id="016062">They attribute to Allah what they hate (for themselves), and their tongues assert the falsehood that the reward most fair is for themselves: without doubt for them is the Fire, and they will be the first to be hastened on into it!</AYA>
		<AYA id="016063">By Allah, We (also) sent (Our messengers) to Peoples before thee; but Satan made, (to the wicked), their own acts seem alluring: He is also their patron today, but they shall have a most grievous chastisement.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016064">And We sent down the Book to thee so that thou shouldst make clear to them those things in which they differ, and that it should be a guide and a mercy to those who believe.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016065">And Allah sends down rain from the skies, and gives therewith life to the earth after its death: verily in this is a Sign for those who listen.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016066">And verily in cattle (too) will ye find an instructive sign. From what is within their bodies between excretions and blood, We produce, for your drink, milk, pure and agreeable to those who drink it.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016067">And from the fruit of the date-palm and the vine, ye get out strong drink and wholesome food: behold, in this also is a sign for those who are wise.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016068">And thy Lord taught the Bee to build its cells in hills, on trees, and in (men's) habitations;</AYA>
		<AYA id="016069">Then to eat of all the produce (of the earth), and follow the ways of thy Lord made smooth: there issues from within their bodies a drink of varying colors, wherein is healing for men: verily in this is a Sign for those who give thought.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016070">It is Allah Who creates you and takes your souls at death; and of you there are some who are sent back to a feeble age, so that they know nothing after having known (much): for Allah is All-Knowing, All-Powerful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016071">Allah has bestowed His gifts of sustenance more freely on some of you than on others: those more favored are not going to throw back their gifts to those whom their right hands possess, so as to be equal in that respect. Will they then deny the favors of Allah?</AYA>
		<AYA id="016072">And Allah has made for you mates (and companions) of your own nature, and made for you, out of them, sons and daughters and grandchildren, and provided for you sustenance of the best: will they then believe in vain things, and be ungrateful for Allah's favors?-</AYA>
		<AYA id="016073">And worship others than Allah,- such as have no power of providing them, for sustenance, with anything in heavens or earth, and cannot possibly have such power?</AYA>
		<AYA id="016074">Invent not similitudes for Allah. for Allah knoweth, and ye know not.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016075">Allah sets forth the Parable (of two men: one) a slave under the dominion of another; He has no power of any sort; and (the other) a man on whom We have bestowed goodly favors from Ourselves, and he spends thereof (freely), privately and publicly: are the two equal? (By no means;) praise be to Allah. But most of them know not.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016076">Allah sets forth (another) Parable of two men: one of them dumb, with no power of any sort; a wearisome burden is he to his master; whichever way be directs him, he brings no good: is such a man equal with one who commands Justice, and is on a Straight Way?</AYA>
		<AYA id="016077">To Allah belongeth the Unseen of the heavens and the earth. And the matter of the Hour (of Judgment) is as the twinkling of an eye, or even quicker: for Allah hath power over all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016078">It is He Who brought you forth from the wombs of your mothers when ye knew nothing; and He gave you hearing and sight and intelligence and affections: that ye may give thanks (to Allah).</AYA>
		<AYA id="016079">Do they not look at the birds, held poised in the midst of (the air and) the sky? Nothing holds them up but (the power of) Allah. Verily in this are signs for those who believe.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016080">It is Allah Who made your habitations homes of rest and quiet for you; and made for you, out of the skins of animals, (tents for) dwellings, which ye find so light (and handy) when ye travel and when ye stop (in your travels); and out of their wool, and their soft fibers (between wool and hair), and their hair, rich stuff and articles of convenience (to serve you) for a time.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016081">81 It is Allah Who made out of the things He created, some things to give you shade; of the hills He made some for your shelter; He made you garments to protect you from heat, and coats of mail to protect you from your (mutual) violence. Thus does He complete His favors on you, that ye may bow to His Will (in Islm).</AYA>
		<AYA id="016082">But if they turn away, thy duty is only to preach the Clear Message.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016083">They recognize the favors of Allah; then they deny them; and most of them are (creatures) ungrateful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016084">One Day We shall raise from all Peoples a Witness: then will no excuse be accepted from Unbelievers, nor will they be allowed to make amends.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016085">When the wrong-doers (actually) see the Chastisement, then will it in no way be mitigated, nor will they then receive respite.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016086">When those who gave partners to Allah will see their "partners", they will say: "Our Lord! these are our 'partners,' those whom we used to invoke besides Thee." But they will throw back their word at them (and say): "Indeed ye are liars!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="016087">That Day shall they (openly) show (their) submission to Allah; and all their inventions shall leave them in the lurch.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016088">Those who reject Allah and hinder (men) from the Path of Allah - for them will We add Chastisement to Chastisement; for that they used to spread mischief.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016089">On the Day We shall raise from all Peoples a witness against them, from amongst themselves: and We shall bring thee as a witness against these (thy people): and We have sent down to thee the Book explaining all things, a Guide, a Mercy, and Glad Tidings to Muslims.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016090">Allah commands justice, the doing of good, and given to kith and kin, and He forbids all indecent deeds, and evil and rebellion: He instructs you, that ye may receive admonition.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016091">Fulfill the Covenant of Allah when ye have entered into it, and break not your oaths after ye have confirmed them; indeed ye have made Allah your surety; for Allah knoweth all that ye do.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016092">And be not like a woman who breaks into untwisted strands the yarn which she has spun, after it has become strong, using your oaths to deceive one another, lest one party should be more numerous than another: for Allah will test you by this; and on the Day of Judgment He will certainly make clear to you (the truth of) that wherein ye disagree.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016093">If Allah so willed, He could make you all one people: But He leaves straying whom He pleases, and He guides whom He pleases: but ye shall certainly be called to account for all your actions.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016094">And take not your oaths, to practice deception between yourselves, with the result that someone's foot may slip after it was firmly planted, and ye may have to taste the evil (consequences) of having hindered (men) from the Path of Allah, and a mighty Wrath descend on you.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016095">Nor sell the covenant of Allah for a miserable price: for with Allah is (a prize) far better for you, if ye only knew.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016096">What is with you must vanish: what is with Allah will endure. And We will certainly bestow, on those who patiently persevere, their reward according to the best of their actions.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016097">Whoever works righteousness, man or woman, and has Faith, verily, to him will We give a new Life, a life that is good and pure and We will bestow on such their reward according to the best of their actions.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016098">When thou dost read the Quran, seek Allah's protection from Satan the rejected one.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016099">No authority has he over those who believe and put their trust in their Lord.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016100">His authority is over those only, who take him as patron and who join partners with Allah.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016101">When We substitute one revelation for another,- and Allah knows best what He reveals (in stages),- they say, "Thou art but a forger": but most of them know not.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016102">Say, the Holy Spirit has brought the revelation from thy Lord in Truth, in order to strengthen those who believe, and as a Guide and Glad Tidings to Muslims.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016103">We know indeed that they say, "It is a man that teaches him." The tongue of him they wickedly point to is notably foreign, while this is Arabic, pure and clear.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016104">Those who believe not in the Signs of Allah,- Allah will not guide them, and theirs will be a grievous Chastisement.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016105">It is those who believe not in the Signs of Allah, that forge falsehood: it is they who lie!</AYA>
		<AYA id="016106">Any one who, after accepting faith in Allah, utters Unbelief,- except under compulsion, his heart remaining firm in Faith - but such as open their breast to Unbelief, on them is Wrath from Allah, and theirs will be a dreadful Chastisement.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016107">This because they love the life of this world better than the Hereafter: and Allah will not guide those who reject Faith.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016108">Those are they whose hearts, ears, and eyes Allah has sealed up, and they take no heed.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016109">Without doubt, in the Hereafter they will be the losers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016110">But verily thy Lord,- to those who leave their homes after trials and persecutions,- and who thereafter strive and fight for the faith and patiently persevere,- thy Lord, after all this is oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016111">On the Day every soul will come up pleading for itself, and every soul will be recompensed (fully) for all its actions, and none will be unjustly dealt with.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016112">Allah sets forth a Parable: a city enjoying security and quiet, abundantly supplied with sustenance from every place: Yet was it ungrateful for the favors of Allah: so Allah made it taste of hunger and terror (in extremes) (closing in on it) like a garment (from every side), because of the (evil) which (its people) wrought.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016113">And there came to them a messenger from among themselves, but they falsely rejected him; so the Wrath seized them even in the midst of their iniquities.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016114">So eat of the sustenance which Allah has provided for you, lawful and good; and be grateful for the favors of Allah, if it is He Whom ye serve.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016115">He has only forbidden you dead meat, and blood, and the flesh of swine, and any (food) over which the name of other than Allah has been invoked. But if one is forced by necessity, without willful disobedience, nor transgressing due limits,- then Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016116">But say not - for any false thing that your tongues may put forth,- "This is lawful, and this is forbidden," so as to ascribe false things to Allah. For those who ascribe false things to Allah, will never prosper.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016117">In such falsehood is but a paltry profit; but they will have a most grievous Chastisement.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016118">To the Jews We prohibited such things as We have mentioned to thee before: We did them no wrong, but they were used to doing wrong to themselves.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016119">But verily thy Lord,- to those who do wrong in ignorance, but who thereafter repent and make amends,- thy Lord, after all this, is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016120">Abraham was indeed a model, devoutly obedient to Allah, (and) true in Faith, and he joined not gods with Allah.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016121">He showed his gratitude for the favo 5c8 rs of Allah, who chose him, and guided him to a Straight Way.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016122">And We gave him Good in this world, and he will be, in the Hereafter, in the ranks of the Righteous.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016123">So We revealed to thee, "Follow the ways of Abraham the True in Faith, and he joined not gods with Allah."</AYA>
		<AYA id="016124">The Sabbath was only made (strict) for those who disagreed (as to its observance); But Allah will judge between them on the Day of Judgment, as to their differences.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016125">Invite (all) to the Way of thy Lord with wisdom and beautiful preaching; and argue with them in ways that are best and most gracious: for thy Lord knoweth best, who have strayed from His Path, and who receive guidance.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016126">And if ye punish, let your punishment be proportional to the wrong that has been done to you: but if ye show patience, that is indeed the best (course) for those who are patient.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016127">And do thou be patient, for thy patience is but from Allah; nor grieve over them: and distress not thyself because of their plots.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016128">For Allah is with those who restrain themselves, and those who do good.</AYA>

		<AYA id="017002">We gave Moses the Book, and made it a Guide to the Children of Israel, (commanding): "Take not other than Me as Disposer of (your) affairs."</AYA>
		<AYA id="017003">O ye that are sprung from those whom We carried (in the Ark) with Noah! Verily he was a devotee most grateful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017004">And We decreed for the Children of Israel in the Book, that twice would they do mischief on the earth and be elated with mighty arrogance (and twice would they be punished)!</AYA>
		<AYA id="017005">When the first of the warnings came to pass, We sent against you Our servants given to terrible warfare. They entered the very inmost parts of your homes; and it was a warning (completely) fulfilled.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017006">Then did We grant you victory over them: We gave you increase in resources and sons, and made you the more numerous in man-power.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017007">If ye did well, ye did well for yourselves; if ye did evil, (ye did it) against yourselves. So when the second of the warnings came to pass, (We permitted your enemies) to disfigure your faces, and to enter your Temple as they had entered it before, and to visit with destruction all that fell into their power.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017008">It may be that your Lord may (yet) show Mercy unto you; but if ye revert (to your sins), We shall revert (to Our punishments): And we have made Hell a prison for those who reject (all Faith).</AYA>
		<AYA id="017009">Verily this Quran doth guide to that which is most right (or stable), and giveth the Glad Tidings to the Believers who work deeds of righteousness, that they shall have a magnificent reward;</AYA>
		<AYA id="017010">And to those who believe not in the Hereafter, (it announceth) that We have prepared for them a Chastisement Grievous (indeed).</AYA>
		<AYA id="017011">Man prays for evil as he prays for good; for man is given to hasty (deeds).</AYA>
		<AYA id="017012">We have made the Night and the Day as two (of Our) Signs: the Sign of the Night have We made dark, while the Sign of the Day We have made bright; that ye may seek bounty from your Lord, and that ye may know the number and count of the years: all things have We explained in detail.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017013">Every man's fate We have fastened on his own neck: On the Day of Judgment We shall bring out for him a scroll, which he will see spread open.</AYA>

		<AYA id="017040">Has then your Lord (O Pagans!) preferred for you sons, and taken for Himself daughters among the angels? Truly ye utter a most dreadful saying!</AYA>
		<AYA id="017041">We have explained (things) in various (ways) in this Quran, in order that they may receive admonition, but it only increases their flight (from the Truth)!</AYA>
		<AYA id="017042">Say: If there had been (other) gods with Him, as they say,- behold, they would certainly have sought out a way in submitting to the Lord of the Throne!</AYA>
		<AYA id="017043">Glory to Him! He is high above all that they say!- Exalted and Great (beyond measure)!</AYA>
		<AYA id="017044">The seven heavens and the earth, and all beings therein, declare His glory: there is not a thing but celebrates His praise; And yet ye understand not how they declare His glory! Verily He is Oft-Forbear, Most Forgiving!</AYA>
		<AYA id="017045">When thou dost recite the Quran, We put, between thee and those who believe not in the Hereafter, a veil invisible:</AYA>
		<AYA id="017046">And We put coverings over their hearts (and minds) lest they should understand the Quran, and deafness into their ears: when thou dost mention thy Lord and Him alone in the Quran, they turn on their backs, fleeing (from the Truth).</AYA>
		<AYA id="017047">We know best what it is they listen, when they listen to thee; and when they meet in private, behold, the wicked say, "Ye follow none other than a man bewitched!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="017048">See what similes they strike for thee: but they have gone astray, and never can they find a way.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017049">They say: "What! when we are reduced to bones and dust, should we really be raised up (to be) a new creation?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="017050">Say: "(Nay!) be ye stones or iron,</AYA>
		<AYA id="017051">"Or any created matter which, in your minds, is hardest (to be raised up),- (yet shall ye be raised up)!" then will they say: "Who will cause us to return?" Say: "He Who created you first!" Then will they wag their heads towards thee, and say, "When will that be?" Say, "May be it will be quite soon!</AYA>
		<AYA id="017052">"It will be on a Day when He will call you, and ye will answer (His call) with (words of) His praise, and ye will think that ye tarried but a little while!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="017053">Say to My servants that they should (only) say those things that are best: for Satan doth sow dissensions among them: For Satan is to man an avowed enemy.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017054">It is your Lord that knoweth you best: If He please, He granteth you mercy, or if He please, punishment: We have not sent thee to be a disposer of their affairs for them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017055">And it is your Lord that knoweth best all beings that are in the heavens and on earth: We made some prophets to excel others: and We gave to David the Psalms.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017056">Say: "Call on those - besides Him - whom ye fancy: they have neither the power to remove your troubles from you nor to change them."</AYA>
		<AYA id="017057">Those whom they call upon do seek (for themselves) means of access to their Lord, - as to who are nearest: they hope for His Mercy and fear His Wrath: for the Wrath of thy Lord is something to take heed of.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017058">There is not a population but We shall destroy it before the Day of Judgment or punish it with a dreadful Chastisement: that is written in the (eternal) Record.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017059">And We refrain from sending the Signs, only because the men of former generations treated them as false: We sent the She-camel to the Thamd - a visible Sign -, but they treated her wrongfully: We only send the Signs by way of frightening (and warning from evil).</AYA>
		<AYA id="017060">Behold! We told thee that thy Lord doth encompass mankind round about: We granted the vision which We showed thee, but as a trial for men,- as also the Cursed Tree (mentioned) in the Quran: We put fear (and warning) into them, but it only increases their inordinate transgression!</AYA>
		<AYA id="017061">Behold! We said to the angels: "Prostrate unto Adam": They prostrated except Iblis: He said, "Shall I prostrate to one whom Thou didst create from clay?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="017062">He said: "Seest Thou? this is the one whom Thou hast honored above me! If Thou wilt but respite me to the Day of Judgment, I will surely bring his descendants under my sway - all but a few!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="017063">(Allah) said: "Go thy way; if any of them follow thee, verily Hell will be the recompense of you (all)- an ample recompense.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017064">"And arose those whom thou canst among them, with thy (seductive) voice; make assaults on them with thy cavalry and thy infantry; mutually share with them wealth and children; and make promises to them." But Satan promises them nothing but deceit.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017065">"As for My servants, no authority shalt thou have over them:" Enough is thy Lord for a Disposer of affairs.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017066">Your Lord is He that maketh the Ship go smoothly for you through the sea, in order that ye may seek of His Bounty. For He is unto you Most Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017067">When distress seizes you at sea, those that ye call upon - besides Himself - leave you in the lurch! but when He brings you back safe to land, ye turn away (from Him). Most ungrateful is man!</AYA>
		<AYA id="017068">Do ye then feel secure that He will not cause you to be swallowed up beneath the earth when ye are on land, or that He will not send against you a violent tornado (with showers of stones) so that ye shall find no protector?</AYA>
		<AYA id="017069">Or do ye feel secure that He will not send you back a second time to sea and send against you a heavy gale to drown you because of your ingratitude, so that ye find no helper therein against Us?</AYA>
		<AYA id="017070">We have honored the sons of Adam; provided them with transport on land and sea; given them for sustenance things good and pure; and conferred on them special favors, above a great part of Our Creation.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017071">On the Day We shall call together all human beings with their (respective) Imams: those who are given their record in their right hand will read it (with pleasure), and they will not be dealt with unjustly in the least.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017072">But those who were blind in this world, will be blind in the hereafter, and most astray from the Path.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017073">And their purpose was to tempt thee away from that which We had revealed unto thee, to substitute in Our Name something quite different; (in that case), behold! they would certainly have made thee (their) friend!</AYA>
		<AYA id="017074">And had We not given thee strength, thou wouldst nearly have inclined to them a little.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017075">In that case We should have made thee taste an equal portion (of punishment) in this life, and an equal portion in death: and moreover thou wouldst have found none to help thee against Us!</AYA>
		<AYA id="017076">Their purpose was to scare thee off the land, in order to expel thee; but in that case they would not have stayed (therein) after thee, except for a little while.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017077">(This was Our) way with the messengers We sent before thee: thou wilt find no change in Our ways.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017078">Establish regular prayers - at the sun's decline till the darkness of the night, and the recital of the Quran in the morning prayer: for the recital of the dawn is witnessed.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017079">And as for the night keep awake a part of it as an additional prayer for thee: soon will thy Lord raise thee to a Station of Praise and Glory!</AYA>
		<AYA id="017080">Say: "O my Lord! Let my entry be by the Gate of Truth and Honor, and likewise my exit by the Gate of Truth and Honor; and grant me from Thee an authority to aid (me)."</AYA>
		<AYA id="017081">And say: "Truth has (now) arrived, and Falsehood perished: for Falsehood is (by its nature) bound to perish."</AYA>
		<AYA id="017082">We send down (stage by stage) in the Quran that which is a healing and a mercy to those who believe: to the unjust it causes nothing but loss after loss.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017083">Yet when We bestow Our favors on man, he turns away and becomes remote on his side (instead of coming to Us), and when evil seizes him he gives himself up to despair!</AYA>
		<AYA id="017084">Say: "Everyone acts according to his own disposition: But your Lord knows best who it is that is best guided on the Way."</AYA>
		<AYA id="017085">They ask thee concerning the Spirit. Say: "The Spirit is off the command of my Lord: of knowledge it is only a little that is communicated to you, (O men!)"</AYA>
		<AYA id="017086">If it were Our Will, We could take away that which We have sent thee by inspiration: then wouldst thou find none to plead thy affair in that matter as against Us,-</AYA>
		<AYA id="017087">Except for Mercy from thy Lord: for His Bounty is to thee (indeed) great.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017088">Say: "If the whole of mankind and Jinns were to gather together to produce the like of this Quran, they could not produce the like thereof, even if they backed up each other with help and support.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017089">And We have explained to man, in this Quran, every kind of similitude: yet the greater part of men refuse (to receive it) except with ingratitude!</AYA>
		<AYA id="017090">They say: "We shall not believe in thee, until thou cause a spring to gush forth for us from the earth,</AYA>
		<AYA id="017091">"Or (until) thou have a garden of date trees and vines, and cause rivers to gush forth in their midst, carrying abundant water;</AYA>
		<AYA id="017092">"Or thou cause the sky to fall in pieces, as thou sayest (will happen), against us; or thou bring Allah and the angels before (us) face to face:</AYA>
		<AYA id="017093">"Or thou have a house adorned with gold, or thou mount a ladder right into the skies. No, we shall not even believe in thy mounting until thou send down to us a book that we could read." Say: "Glory to my Lord! Am I aught but a man,- a messenger?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="017094">What kept men back from belief when Guidance came to them, was nothing but this: they said, "Has Allah sent a man (like us) to be (His) Messenger."</AYA>
		<AYA id="017095">Say, "If there were settled, on earth, angels walking about in peace and quiet, We should certainly have sent them down from the heavens an angel for a messenger."</AYA>
		<AYA id="017096">Say: "Enough is Allah for a witness between me and you: for He is well acquainted with His servants, and He sees (all things).</AYA>
		<AYA id="017097">It is he whom Allah guides, that is on true Guidance; but he whom He leaves astray - for such wilt thou find no protector besides Him. On the Day of Judgment We shall gather, them together, prone on their faces, blind, dumb, and deaf: their abode will be Hell: every time it shows abatement, We shall increase for them the fierceness of the Fire.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017098">That is their recompense, because they rejected Our Signs, and said, "When we are reduced to bones and broken dust, should we really be raised up (to be) a new Creation?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="017099">See they not that Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth, has power to create the like of them (anew)? Only He has decreed a term appointed, of which there is no doubt. But the unjust refuse (to receive it) except with ingratitude.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017100">Say: "If ye had control of the Treasures of the Mercy of my Lord, behold, ye would keep them back, for fear of spending them: for man is (every) niggardly!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="017101">To Moses We did give Nine Clear Sings: As the Children of Israel: when he came to them, Pharaoh said to him: "O Moses! I consider thee, indeed, to have been worked upon by sorcery!</AYA>
		<AYA id="017102">Moses said, "Thou knowest well that these things have been sent down by none but the Lord of the heavens and the earth as eye-opening evidence: and I consider thee indeed, O Pharaoh, to be one doomed to destruction!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="017103">So he resolved to remove them from the face of the earth: but We did drown him and all who were with him.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017104">And We said thereafter to the Children of Israel, "Dwell securely in the land (of promise)": but when the second of the warnings came to pass, We gathered you together in a mingled crowd.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017105">We sent down the (Qurn) in Truth, and in Truth has it descended: and We sent thee but to give Glad Tidings and to warn (sinners).</AYA>
		<AYA id="017106">(It is) a Quran which We have divided (into parts from time to time), in order that thou mightest recite it to men at intervals: We have revealed it by stages.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017107">Say: "Whether ye believe in it or not, it is true that those who were given knowledge beforehand, when it is recited to them, fall down on their faces in humble prostration,</AYA>
		<AYA id="017108">"And they say: 'Glory to our Lord! Truly has the promise of our Lord been fulfilled!'"</AYA>
		<AYA id="017109">They fall down on their faces in tears, and it increases their (earnest) humility.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017110">Say: "Call upon Allah, or call upon Rahmn: by whatever name ye call upon Him, (it is well): for to Him belong the Most Beautiful Names. Neither speak thy Prayer aloud, nor speak it in a low tone, but seek a middle course between."</AYA>
		<AYA id="017111">Say: "Praise be to Allah, who begets no son, and has no partner in (His) dominion: Nor (needs) He any to protect Him from humiliation: yea, magnify Him for His greatness and glory!"</AYA>

	<SOURA id="18" name="The Cave">
		<AYA id="018001">Praise be to Allah, Who hath sent to His Servant the Book, and hath allowed therein no Crookedness:</AYA>
		<AYA id="018002">(He hath made it) Straight (and Clear) in order that He may warn (the godless) of a terrible Punishment from Him, and that He may give Glad Tidings to the Believers who work righteous deeds, that they shall have a goodly Reward,</AYA>
		<AYA id="018003">Wherein they shall remain for ever:</AYA>
		<AYA id="018004">Further, that He may warn those (also) who say, "Allah hath begotten a son":</AYA>
		<AYA id="018005">No knowledge have they of such a thing, nor had their fathers. It is a grievous thing that issues from their mouths as a saying what they say is nothing but falsehood!</AYA>
		<AYA id="018006">Thou wouldst only, perchance, fret thyself to death, following after them, in grief, if they believe not in this Message.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018007">That which is on earth we have made but as a glittering show for it, in order that We may test them - as to which of them are best in conduct.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018008">Verily what is on earth we shall make but as dust and dry soil (without growth or herbage).</AYA>
		<AYA id="018009">Or dost thou think that the Companions of the Cave and of the Inscription were wonders among Our Sign?</AYA>
		<AYA id="018010">Behold, the youths betook themselves to the Cave: they said, "Our Lord! bestow on us Mercy from Thyself, and dispose of our affair for us in the right way!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="018011">Then We draw (a veil) over their ears, for a number of years, in the Cave, (so that they heard not):</AYA>
		<AYA id="018012">Then We roused them, in order to test which of the two parties was best at calculating the term of years they had tarried!</AYA>
		<AYA id="018013">We relate to thee their story in truth: they were youths who believed in their Lord, and We advanced them in guidance:</AYA>
		<AYA id="018014">We gave strength to their hearts: Behold, they stood up and said: "Our Lord is the Lord of the heavens and of the earth: never shall we call upon any god other than Him: if we did, we should indeed have uttered an enormity!</AYA>
		<AYA id="018015">"These our people have taken for worship gods other than Him: why do they not bring forward an authority clear (and convincing) for what they do? Who doth more wrong than such as invent a falsehood against Allah?</AYA>
		<AYA id="018016">"When ye turn away from them and the things they worship other than Allah, betake yourselves to the Cave: Your Lord will shower His mercies on you and disposes of your affair towards comfort and ease."</AYA>
		<AYA id="018017">Thou wouldst have seen the sun, when it rose, declining to the right from their Cave, and when it set, turning away from them to the left, while they lay in the open space in the midst of the Cave. Such are among the Signs of Allah. He whom Allah, guides is rightly guided; but he whom Allah leaves to stray,- for him wilt thou find no protector to lead him to the Right Way.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018018">Thou wouldst have thought them, whilst they were asleep, and We turned them on their right and on their left sides: their dog stretching forth his two fore-legs on the threshold: if thou hadst looked at them, thou wouldst have certainly turned back from them in flight, and wouldst certainly have been filled with terror of them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018019">Such (being their state), We raised them up (from sleep), that they might question each other. Said one of them, "How long have ye stayed (here)?" They said, "We have stayed (perhaps) a day, or part of a day." (At length) they (all) said, "(Allah) (alone) knows best how long ye have stayed here.... Now send ye then one of you with this money of yours to the town: let him find out which is the best food (to be had) and bring some to you, (that ye may satisfy your hunger therewith): And let him behave with care and courtesy, and let him not inform any one about you.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018020">"For if they should come upon you, they would stone you or force you to return to their religion, and in that case ye would never attain prosperity."</AYA>
		<AYA id="018021">Thus did We make their case known to the people, that they might know that the promise of Allah is true, and that there can be no doubt about the Hour of Judgment. Behold, they dispute among themselves as to their affair. (Some) said, "Construct a building over them": Their Lord knows best about them: those who prevailed over their affair said, "Let us surely build a place of worship over them."</AYA>
		<AYA id="018022">(Some) say they were three, the dog being the fourth among them; (others) say they were five, the dog being the sixth,- doubtfully guessing at the unknown; (yet others) say they were seven, the dog being the eighth. Say thou: "My Lord knoweth best their number; It is but few that know their (real case)." Enter not, therefore, into controversies concerning them, except on a matter that is clear, nor consult any of them about (the affair of) the Sleepers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018023">Nor say of anything, "I shall be sure to do so and so tomorrow"-</AYA>
		<AYA id="018024">Except "If Allah so wills," and remember thy Lord when thou forgettest, and say, "I hope that my Lord will guide me ever closer (even) than this to the right course."</AYA>
		<AYA id="018025">So they stayed in their Cave three hundred years, and nine (more).</AYA>
		<AYA id="018026">Say: "Allah knows best how long they stayed: with Him is (the knowledge of) the secrets of the heavens and the earth: how clearly He sees, how finely He hears (everything)! They have no protector other than Him; nor does He share His Command with any person whatsoever.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018027">And recite (and teach) what has been revealed to thee of the Book of thy Lord: none can change His Words, and none wilt thou find as a refuge other than Him.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018028">And keep yourself content with those who call on their Lord morning and evening, seeking His Face; and let not thine eyes pass beyond them, seeking the pomp and glitter of this Life; nor obey any whose heart We have permitted to neglect the remembrance of Us, one who follows his own desires, and his affair has become all excess.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018029">Say, "The Truth is from your Lord": Let him who will believe, and let him who will, reject (it): for the wrong-doers We have prepared a Fire whose (smoke and flames), like the walls and roof of a tent, will hem them in: if they implore relief they will be granted water like melted brass, that will scald their faces, how dreadful the drink! How uncomfortable a couch to recline on!</AYA>
		<AYA id="018030">As to those who believe and work righteousness, verily We shall not suffer to perish the reward of any who do a (single) righteous deed.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018031">For them will be Gardens of Eternity; beneath them rivers will flow; they will be adorned therein with bracelets of gold, and they will wear green garments of fine silk and heavy brocade: They will recline therein on raised thrones. How good the recompense! How beautiful a couch to recline on!</AYA>
		<AYA id="018032">Set forth to them the parable of two men: for one of them We provided two gardens of grape-vines and surrounded them with date palms; in between the two We placed tillage.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018033">Each of those gardens brought forth its produce, and failed not in the least therein: in the midst of them We caused a river to flow.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018034">(Abundant) was the produce this man had : he said to his companion, in the course of a mutual argument: "more wealth have I than you, and more honor and power in (my following of) men."</AYA>
		<AYA id="018035">He went into his garden while he wronged himself: He said, "I deem not that this will ever perish,</AYA>
		<AYA id="018036">"Nor do I deem that the Hour (of Judgment) will (ever) come: Even if I am brought back to my Lord, I shall surely find (there) something better in exchange."</AYA>
		<AYA id="018037">His companion said to him, in the course of the argument with him: "Dost thou deny Him Who created thee out of dust, then out of a sperm-drop, then fashioned thee into a man?</AYA>
		<AYA id="018038">"But as for my part, Allah is my Lord, and none shall I associate with my Lord.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018039">"Why didst thou not, as thou wentest into thy garden, say: 'Allah's will (be done)! There is no power but with Allah.' If thou dost see me less than thee in wealth and sons,</AYA>
		<AYA id="018040">"It may be that my Lord will give me something better than thy garden, and that He will send on thy garden thunderbolts (by way of reckoning) from heaven, making it (but) slippery sand!-</AYA>
		<AYA id="018041">"Or the water of the garden will run off underground so that thou wilt never be able to find it."</AYA>
		<AYA id="018042">So his fruits were encompassed (with ruin), and he remained twisting and turning his hands over what he had spent on his property, which had (now) tumbled to pieces to its very foundations, and he could only say, "Woe is me! Would I had never ascribed partners to my Lord and Cherisher!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="018043">Nor had he numbers to help him against Allah, nor was he able to deliver himself.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018044">There, the (only) protection comes from Allah, the True One. He is the Best to reward, and the Best to give success.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018045">Set forth to them the similitude of the life of this world: It is like the rain which We send down from the skies: the earth's vegetation absorbs it, but soon it becomes dry stubble, which the winds do scatter: it is (only) Allah who prevails over all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018046">Wealth and sons are allurements of the life of this world: But the things that endure, good deeds, are best in the sight of thy Lord, as rewards, and best as (the foundation for) hopes.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018047">On the Day We shall remove the mountains, and thou wilt see the earth as a level stretch, and We shall gather them, all together, nor shall We leave out any one of them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018048">And they will be marshaled before thy Lord in ranks, (with the announcement), "Now have ye come to Us (bare) as We created you first: aye, ye thought We shall not fulfill the appointment made to you to meet (Us)!":</AYA>
		<AYA id="018049">And the Book (of Deeds) will be placed (before you); and thou wilt see the sinful in great terror because of what is (recorded) therein; they will say, "Ah! woe to us! what a Book is this! It leaves out nothing small or great, but takes account thereof!" They will find all that they did, placed before them: And not one will thy Lord treat with injustice.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018050">Behold! We said to the angels, "Prostrate to Adam": they prostrated except Iblis. He was one of the Jinns, and he broke the Command of his Lord. Will ye then take him and his progeny as protectors rather than Me? And they are enemies to you! Evil would be the exchange for the wrong-doers!</AYA>
		<AYA id="018051">I called them not to witness the creation of the heavens and the earth, not (even) their own creation: nor is it for Me to take as helpers such as lead (men) astray!</AYA>
		<AYA id="018052">On the Day He will say, "Call on those whom ye thought to be My partners," and they will call on them, but they will not listen to them; and We shall make for them a place of common perdition.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018053">And the Sinful shall see the fire and apprehend that they have to fall therein: no means will they find to turn away therefrom.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018054">We have explained in detail in this Quran, for the benefit of mankind, every kind of similitude: but man is, in most things, contentious.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018055">And what is there to keep back men from believing, now that Guidance has come to them, nor from praying for forgiveness from their Lord, but that (they wait for) the ways of the ancients to overtake them, or the Wrath be brought to them face to face?</AYA>
		<AYA id="018056">We only send the messengers to give Glad Tidings and to give warnings: But the unbelievers dispute with vain argument, in order therewith to weaken the truth, and they treat My Signs as a jest, as also the fact that they are warned!</AYA>
		<AYA id="018057">And who doth more wrong than one who is reminded of the Signs of his Lord, but turns away from them, forgetting the (deeds) which his hands have sent forth? Verily We have set veils over their hearts so that they understand this not, and over their ears, deafness. If thou callest them to guidance, even then will they never accept guidance.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018058">But your Lord is Most forgiving, full of Mercy. If He were to call them (at once) to account for what they have earned, then surely He would have hastened their punishment: but they have their appointed time, beyond which they will find no refuge.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018059">Such were the towns we destroyed when they committed iniquities; but we fixed an appointed time for their destruction.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018060">Behold, Moses said to his attendant, "I will not give up until I reach the junction of the two seas or (until) I spend years and years in travel."</AYA>
		<AYA id="018061">But when they reached the Junction, they forgot (about) their Fish, which took its course through the sea (straight) as in a tunnel.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018062">When they had passed on (some distance), Moses said to his attendant: "Bring us our early meal; truly we have suffered much fatigue at this (stage of) our journey."</AYA>
		<AYA id="018063">He replied: "Sawest thou (what happened) when we betook ourselves to the rock? I did indeed forget (about) the Fish: none but Satan made me forget to tell (you) about it: it took its course through the sea in a marvelous way!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="018064">Moses said: "That was what we were seeking after:" So they went back on their footsteps, following (the path they had come).</AYA>
		<AYA id="018065">So they found one of Our servants, on whom We had bestowed Mercy from Ourselves and whom We had taught knowledge from Our own Presence.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018066">Moses said to him: "May I follow thee, on the footing that thou teach me something of the (Higher) Truth which thou hast been taught?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="018067">(The other) said: "Verily thou wilt not be able to have patience with me!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="018068">"And how canst thou have patience about things which are beyond your knowledge?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="018069">Moses said: "Thou wilt find me, if Allah so will, (truly) patient: nor shall I disobey thee in aught."</AYA>
		<AYA id="018070">The other said: "If then thou wouldst follow me, ask me no questions about anything until I myself speak to thee concerning it."</AYA>
		<AYA id="018071">So they both proceeded: until, when they were in the boat, he scuttled it. Said Moses: "Hast thou scuttled it in order to drown those in it? Truly a strange thing hast thou done!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="018072">He answered: "Did I not tell thee that thou canst have no patience with me?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="018073">Moses said: "Rebuke me not for forgetting, nor grieve me by raising difficulties in my case."</AYA>
		<AYA id="018074">Then they proceeded: until, when they met a young boy, he slew him. Moses said: "Hast thou slain an innocent person who had slain none? Truly a foul (unheard of) thing hast thou done!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="018075">He answered: "Did I not tell thee that thou canst have no patience with me?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="018076">(Moses) said: "If ever I ask thee about anything after this, keep me not in thy company: then wouldst thou have received (full) excuse from my side."</AYA>
		<AYA id="018077">Then they proceeded: until, when they came to the inhabitants of a town, they asked them for food, but they refused them hospitality. They found there a wall on the point of falling down, but he set it up straight. (Moses) said: "If thou hadst wished, surely thou couldst have exacted some recompense for it!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="018078">He answered: "This is the parting between me and thee: now will I tell thee the interpretation of (those things) over which thou wast unable to hold patience.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018079">"As for the boat, it belonged to certain men in dire want: they plied on the water: I but wished to render it unserviceable, for there was after them a certain king who seized on every boat by force.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018080">"As for the youth, his parents were people of faith, and we feared that he would grieve them by obstinate rebellion and ingratitude (to Allah).</AYA>
		<AYA id="018081">"So we desired that their Lord would give them in exchange (a son) better in purity (of conduct) and closer in affection.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018082">"As for the wall, it belonged to two youths, orphans, in the Town; there was, beneath it, a buried treasure, to which they were entitled: their father had been a righteous man: So thy Lord desired that they should attain their age of full strength and get out their treasure - a mercy (and favor) from thy Lord. I did it not of my own accord. Such is the interpretation of (those things) over which thou wast unable to hold patience."</AYA>
		<AYA id="018083">They ask thee concerning Zulqarnain. Say, "I will rehearse to you something of his story."</AYA>
		<AYA id="018084">Verily We established his power on earth, and We gave him the ways and the means to all ends.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018085">One (such) way he followed,</AYA>
		<AYA id="018086">Until, when he reached the setting of the sun, he found it set in a spring of murky water: near it he found a People: We said: "O Zulqarnain! (thou hast authority,) either to punish them, or to treat them with kindness."</AYA>
		<AYA id="018087">He said: "Whoever doth wrong, him shall we punish; then shall he be sent back to his Lord; and He will punish him with a punishment unheard of (before).</AYA>
		<AYA id="018088">"But whoever believes, and works righteousness,- he shall have a goodly reward, and easy will be his task as we order it by Our command."</AYA>
		<AYA id="018089">Then followed he (another) way,</AYA>
		<AYA id="018090">Until, when he came to the rising of the sun, he found it rising on a people for whom We had provided no covering protection against the sun.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018091">(He left them) as they were: We completely understood what was before him.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018092">Then followed he (another) way,</AYA>
		<AYA id="018093">Until, when he reached (a tract) between two mountains, he found, beneath them, a people who scarcely understood a word.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018094">They said: "O Zulqarnain! the Gog and Magog (People) do great mischief on earth: shall we then render thee tribute in order that thou mightest erect a barrier between us and them?</AYA>
		<AYA id="018095">He said: "(The power) in which my Lord has established me is better (than tribute). Help me therefore with strength (and labor): I will erect a strong barrier between you and them:</AYA>
		<AYA id="018096">"Bring me blocks of iron." At length, when a89 he had filled up the space between the two steep mountain-sides, He said, "Blow (with your bellows)" Then, when he had made it (red) as fire, he said: "Bring me, that I may pour over it, molten lead."</AYA>
		<AYA id="018097">Thus were they made powerless to scale it or to dig through it.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018098">He said: "This is a mercy from my Lord: But when the promise of my Lord comes to pass, He will make it into dust; and the promise of my Lord is true."</AYA>
		<AYA id="018099">On that day We shall leave them to surge like waves on one another: the trumpet will be blown, and We shall collect them all together.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018100">And We shall present Hell that day for Unbelievers to see, all spread out,-</AYA>
		<AYA id="018101">(Unbelievers) whose eyes had been under a veil from remembrance of Me, and who had been unable even to hear.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018102">Do the Unbelievers think that they can take My servants as protectors besides Me? Verily We have prepared Hell for the Unbelievers for (their) entertainment.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018103">Say: "Shall we tell you of those who lose most in respect of their deeds?-</AYA>
		<AYA id="018104">"Those whose efforts have been wasted in this life, while they thought that they were acquiring good by their works?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="018105">They are those who deny the Signs of their Lord and the fact of their having to meet Him (in the Hereafter): vain will be their works, nor shall We, on the Day of Judgment, give them any weight.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018106">That is their reward, Hell; because they rejected Faith, and took My Signs and My Messengers by way of jest.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018107">As to those who believe and work righteous deeds, they have, for their entertainment, the Gardens of Paradise,</AYA>
		<AYA id="018108">Wherein they shall dwell (for aye): no change will they wish for from them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018109">Say: "If the ocean were ink (wherewith to write out) the words of my Lord, sooner would the ocean be exhausted than would the words of my Lord, even if we added another ocean like it, for its aid."</AYA>
		<AYA id="018110">Say: "I am but a man like yourselves, (but) the inspiration has come to me, that your God is One God. whoever expects to meet his Lord, let him work righteousness, and, in the worship of his Lord, admit no one as partner.</AYA>

		<AYA id="019002">(This is) a mention of the Mercy of thy Lord to His servant Zakariya.</AYA>
		<AYA id="019003">Behold! he cried to his Lord in secret,</AYA>
		<AYA id="019004">Praying: "O my Lord! infirm indeed are my bones, and the hair of my head doth glisten with gray: but never am I unblest, O my Lord, in my prayer to Thee!</AYA>
		<AYA id="019005">"Now I fear (what) my relatives (and colleagues) (will do) after me: but my wife is barren: so give me an heir as from Thyself,-</AYA>
		<AYA id="019006">"(One that) will (truly) inherit me, and inherit the posterity of Jacob; and make him, O my Lord! one with whom Thou art well-pleased!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="019007">(His prayer was answered): "O Zakariya! We give thee good news of a son: His name shall be Yahy: (John)on none by that name have We conferred distinction before."</AYA>
		<AYA id="019008">He said: "O my Lord! How shall I have a son, when my wife is barren and I have grown quite decrepit from old age?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="019009">He said: "So (it will be) thy Lord saith, 'That is easy for Me: I did indeed create thee before, when thou hadst been nothing!' "</AYA>
		<AYA id="019010">(Zakariya) said: "O my Lord! give me a Sign." "Thy Sign," was the answer, "Shall be that thou shalt speak to no man for three nights, although thou art not dumb."</AYA>
		<AYA id="019011">So Zakariya came out to his people from him chamber. He told them by signs to celebrate Allah's praises in the morning and in the evening.</AYA>
		<AYA id="019012">(To his son came the command): "O John! take hold of the Book with might": and We gave him Wisdom even as a youth,</AYA>
		<AYA id="019013">And pity (for all creatures) as from Us, and purity: He was devout,</AYA>
		<AYA id="019014">And kind to his parents, and he was not overbearing or rebellious.</AYA>
		<AYA id="019015">So Peace on him the day he was born, the day that he dies, and the day that he will be raised up to life (again)!</AYA>
		<AYA id="019016">Relate in the Book (the story of) Mary, when she withdrew from her family to a place in the East.</AYA>
		<AYA id="019017">She placed a screen (to screen herself) from them; then We sent her Our angel, and he appeared before her as a man in all respects.</AYA>
		<AYA id="019018">She said: "I seek refuge from thee to (Allah) Most Gracious: (come not near) if thou dost fear Allah."</AYA>
		<AYA id="019019">He said: "Nay, I am only a messenger from thy Lord, (to announce) to thee the gift of a pure son.</AYA>
		<AYA id="019020">She said: "How shall I have a son, seeing that no man has touched me, and I am not unchaste?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="019021">He said: "So (it will be): thy Lord saith, 'That is easy for Me: and (We wish) to appoint him as a Sign unto men and a Mercy from Us'. It is a matter (so) decreed."</AYA>
		<AYA id="019022">So she conceived him, and she retired with him to a remote place.</AYA>
		<AYA id="019023">And the pains of childbirth drove her to the trunk of a palm-tree. She cried (in her anguish): "Ah! would that I had died before this! would that I had been a thing forgotten!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="019024">But (a voice) cried to her from beneath the (palm-tree): "Grieve not! for thy Lord hath provided a rivulet beneath thee;</AYA>

		<AYA id="019027">At length she brought the (babe) to her people, carrying him (in her arms). They said: "O Mary! truly a strange thing has thou brought!</AYA>
		<AYA id="019028">"O sister of Aaron! Thy father was not a man of evil, nor thy mother a woman unchaste!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="019029">But she pointed to the babe. They said: "How can we talk to one who is a child in the cradle?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="019030">He said: "I am indeed a servant of Allah. He hath given me revelation and made me a prophet;</AYA>
		<AYA id="019031">"And He hath made me blessed wheresoever I be, and hath enjoined on me Prayer and Charity as long as I live;</AYA>
		<AYA id="019032">"(He hath made me) kind to my mother, and not overbearing or unblest;</AYA>

		<AYA id="019034">Such (was) Jesus the son of Mary: (it is) a statement of truth, about which they (vainly) dispute.</AYA>
		<AYA id="019035">It is not befitting to (the majesty of) Allah that He should beget a son. Glory be to Him! when He determines a matter, He only says to it, "Be", and it is.</AYA>
		<AYA id="019036">Verily Allah is my Lord and your Lord: Him therefore serve ye: this is a Way that is straight.</AYA>
		<AYA id="019037">But the sects differ among themselves: and woe to the Unbelievers because of the (coming) Judgment of an awful Day!</AYA>

		<AYA id="019040">It is We Who will inherit the earth, and all beings thereon: to Us will they all be returned.</AYA>
		<AYA id="019041">(Also) mention in the Book (the story of) Abraham. He was a man of Truth, a prophet.</AYA>
		<AYA id="019042">Behold, he said to his father: "O my father! Why worship that which heareth not and seeth not, and can profit thee nothing?</AYA>
		<AYA id="019043">"O my father! to me hath come knowledge which hath not reached thee: so follow me: I will guide thee to a Way that is even and straight.</AYA>
		<AYA id="019044">"O my father! serve not Satan: for Satan is a rebel against (Allah) Most Gracious.</AYA>
		<AYA id="019045">"O my father! I fear lest a Chastisement afflict thee from (Allah) Most Gracious, so that thou become to Satan a friend."</AYA>
		<AYA id="019046">(The father) replied: "Art thou shrinking from my gods, O Abraham? If thou forbear not, I will indeed stone thee: Now get away from me for a good long while!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="019047">Abraham said: "Peace be on thee: I will pray to my Lord for thy forgiveness: for He is to me Most Gracious.</AYA>
		<AYA id="019048">"And I will turn away from you (all) and from those whom ye invoke besides Allah. I will call on my Lord: perhaps, by my prayer to my Lord, I shall be not unblest."</AYA>
		<AYA id="019049">When he had turned away from them and from those whom they worshipped besides Allah, We bestowed on him Isaac and Jacob, and each one of them We made a prophet.</AYA>
		<AYA id="019050">And We bestowed of Our Mercy on them, and We granted them lofty honor on the tongue of truth.</AYA>
		<AYA id="019051">Also mention in the Book (the story of) Moses: for he was specially chosen, and he was a messenger (and) a prophet.</AYA>
		<AYA id="019052">And We called him from the right side of Mount (Sinai), and made him draw near to Us, for converse in secret.</AYA>
		<AYA id="019053">And, out of Our Mercy, We gave him his brother Aaron, (also) a prophet.</AYA>
		<AYA id="019054">Also mention in the Book (the story of) Ismail: He was (strictly) true to what he promised, and he was a messenger (and) a prophet.</AYA>
		<AYA id="019055">He used to enjoin on his people prayer and charity, and he was most acceptable in the sight of his Lord.</AYA>
		<AYA id="019056">Also mention in the Book Idrs: he was a man of truth (and sincerity), (and) a prophet:</AYA>
		<AYA id="019057">And We raised him to a lofty station.</AYA>
		<AYA id="019058">Those were some of the prophets on whom Allah did bestow His Grace,- of the posterity of Adam, and of those who We carried (in the Ark) with Noah, and of the posterity of Abraham and Israel of those whom We guided and chose. Whenever the Signs of (Allah) Most Gracious were rehearsed to them, they would fall down in prostrate adoration and in tears.</AYA>
		<AYA id="019059">But after them there followed a posterity who missed prayers and followed after lusts soon, then, will they face Destruction,-</AYA>
		<AYA id="019060">Except those who repent and believe, and work righteousness: for these will enter the Garden and will not be wronged in the least,-</AYA>
		<AYA id="019061">Gardens of Eternity, those which (Allah) Most Gracious has promised to His servants in the Unseen: for His promise must (necessarily) come to pass.</AYA>
		<AYA id="019062">They will not there hear any vain discourse, but only salutations of Peace: And they will have therein their sustenance, morning and evening.</AYA>
		<AYA id="019063">Such is the Garden which We give as an inheritance to those of Our servants who guard against evil.</AYA>
		<AYA id="019064">(The angels say:) "We descend not but by command of thy Lord: to Him belongeth what is before us and what is behind us, and what is between: and thy Lord never doth forget,-</AYA>
		<AYA id="019065">"Lord of the heavens and of the earth, and of all that is between them; so worship Him, and be constant and patient in His worship: knowest thou of any who is worthy of the same Name as He?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="019066">Man says: "What! When I am dead, shall I then be raised up alive?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="019067">But does not man call to mind that We created him before out of nothing?</AYA>
		<AYA id="019068">So, by thy Lord, without doubt, We shall gather them together, and (also) the Satans (with them); then shall We bring them forth on their knees round about Hell;</AYA>
		<AYA id="019069">Then shall We certainly drag out from every sect all those who were worst in obstinate rebellion against (Allah) Most Gracious.</AYA>
		<AYA id="019070">And certainly We know best those who are most worthy of being burned therein.</AYA>
		<AYA id="019071">Not one of you but will pass over it: this is, with thy Lord, a Decree which must be accomplished.</AYA>
		<AYA id="019072">But We shall save those who guarded against evil, and We shall leave the wrong-doers therein, (humbled) to their knees.</AYA>
		<AYA id="019073">When Our Clear Signs are rehearsed to them, the Unbelievers say to those who believe, "Which of the two sides is best in point of position and fairer in assembly?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="019074">But how many (countless) generations before them have We destroyed, who were even better in equipment and in glitter to the eye?</AYA>
		<AYA id="019075">Say: "Whoever goes astray, (Allah) Most Gracious extends (the rope) to them, until, when they see the warning of Allah (being fulfilled) - either in punishment or in (the approach of) the Hour,- they will at length realize who is worst in position, and (who) weakest in forces!</AYA>
		<AYA id="019076">"And Allah doth advance in guidance those who seek guidance: and the things that endure, Good Deeds, are best in the sight of thy Lord, as rewards, and best in respect of (their) eventual return."</AYA>
		<AYA id="019077">Hast thou then seen the (sort of) man who rejects Our Signs, yet says: "I shall certainly be given wealth and children?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="019078">Has he penetrated to the Unseen, or has he taken a contract with the Most Gracious?</AYA>
		<AYA id="019079">Nay! We shall record what he says, and We shall add and add to his punishment.</AYA>
		<AYA id="019080">To Us shall return all that he talks of and he shall appear before Us bare and alone.</AYA>
		<AYA id="019081">And they have taken (for worship) gods other than Allah, to give them power and glory!</AYA>
		<AYA id="019082">Instead, they shall reject their worship, and become adversaries against them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="019083">Seest thou not that We have set the Satans on against the Unbelievers, to incite them with fury?</AYA>
		<AYA id="019084">So make no haste against them, for We but count out to them a (limited) number (of days).</AYA>
		<AYA id="019085">The day We shall gather the righteous to (Allah) Most Gracious, like a band (presented before a king for honors,)</AYA>
		<AYA id="019086">And We shall drive the sinners to Hell, (like thirsty cattle driven down to water,-)</AYA>
		<AYA id="019087">None shall have the power of intercession, but such a one as has received permission (or promise) from (Allah) Most Gracious.</AYA>
		<AYA id="019088">They say: "The Most Gracious has begotten a son!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="019089">Indeed ye have put forth a thing most monstrous!</AYA>
		<AYA id="019090">At it the skies are about to burst, the earth to split asunder, and the mountains to fall down in utter ruin,</AYA>
		<AYA id="019091">That they attributed a son for the Most Gracious.</AYA>
		<AYA id="019092">For it is not consonant with the majesty of the Most Gracious that He should beget a son.</AYA>
		<AYA id="019093">Not one of the beings in the heavens and the earth but must come to the Most Gracious as a servant.</AYA>
		<AYA id="019094">He does take an account of them (all), and hath numbered them (all) exactly.</AYA>
		<AYA id="019095">And everyone of them will come to Him singly on the Day of Judgment.</AYA>
		<AYA id="019096">On those who believe and work deeds of righteousness, will the Most Gracious bestow love.</AYA>
		<AYA id="019097">So have We made the (Qurn) easy in thine own tongue, that with it thou mayest give Glad Tidings to the righteous, and warnings to people given to contention.</AYA>

		<AYA id="020051">(Pharaoh) said: "What then is the condition of previous generations?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="020052">He replied: "The knowledge of that is with my Lord, duly recorded: my Lord never errs, nor forgets,-</AYA>
		<AYA id="020053">"He Who has, made for you the earth like a carpet spread out; has enabled you to go about therein by roads (and channels); and has sent down water from the sky." With it have We produced diverse pairs of plants each separate from the others.</AYA>
		<AYA id="020054">Eat (for yourselves) and pasture your cattle: verily, in this are Signs for men endued with understanding.</AYA>
		<AYA id="020055">From the (earth) did We create you, and into it shall We return you, and from it shall We bring you out once again.</AYA>
		<AYA id="020056">And We showed Pharaoh all Our Signs, but he did reject and refuse.</AYA>
		<AYA id="020057">He said: "Hast thou come to drive us out of our land with thy magic, O Moses?</AYA>
		<AYA id="020058">"But we can surely produce magic to match thine! So make a tryst between us and thee, which we shall not fail to keep - neither we nor thou - in a place where both shall have even chances."</AYA>
		<AYA id="020059">Moses said: "Your tryst is the Day of the Festival, and let the people be assembled when the sun is well up."</AYA>
		<AYA id="020060">So Pharaoh withdrew: He concerted his plan, and then came (back).</AYA>
		<AYA id="020061">Moses said to them: "Woe to you! Forge not ye a lie against Allah, lest He destroy you (at once) utterly by chastisement: the forger must suffer failure!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="020062">So they disputed, one with another, over their affair, but they kept their talk secret.</AYA>
		<AYA id="020063">They said: "These two are certainly (expert) magicians: their object is to drive you out from your land with their magic, and to do away with your most cherished way.</AYA>
		<AYA id="020064">"Therefore concert your plan, and then assemble in (serried) ranks. He wins (all along) today who gains the upper hand."</AYA>
		<AYA id="020065">They said: "O Moses! whether wilt thou that thou throw (first) or that we be the first to throw?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="020066">He said, "Nay, throw ye first!" Then behold their ropes and their rods-so it seemed to him on account of their magic - began to be in lively motion!</AYA>
		<AYA id="020067">So Moses conceived in his mind a (sort of) fear.</AYA>
		<AYA id="020068">We said: "Fear not! for thou hast indeed the upper hand:</AYA>
		<AYA id="020069">"Throw that which is in thy right hand. Quickly will it swallow up that which they have faked: what they have faked is but a magician's trick: and the magician succeeds not, (no matter) where he goes."</AYA>
		<AYA id="020070">So the magicians were thrown down to prostration: they said, "We believe in the Lord of Aaron and Moses".</AYA>
		<AYA id="020071">(Pharaoh) said: "Believe ye in Him before I give you permission? Surely this must be your leader, who has taught you magic! be sure I will cut off your hands and feet on opposite sides, and I will have you crucified on trunks of palm-trees: so shall ye know for certain, which of us can give the more severe and the more lasting punishment!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="020072">They said: "Never shall we prefer thee to what has come to us of the Clear Signs, Him Who created us! So decree whatever thou desirest to decree: for thou canst only decree (touching) the life of this world.</AYA>
		<AYA id="020073">"For us, we have believed in our Lord: may He forgive us our faults, and the magic to which thou didst compel us: for Allah is Best and Most Abiding."</AYA>
		<AYA id="020074">Verily he who comes to his Lord as a sinner (at Judgment),- for him is Hell: therein shall he neither die nor live.</AYA>
		<AYA id="020075">But such as come to Him as Believers who have worked righteous deeds,- for them are ranks exalted,-</AYA>
		<AYA id="020076">Gardens of Eternity, beneath which flow rivers: they will dwell therein for aye: such is the reward of those who purify themselves (from evil).</AYA>
		<AYA id="020077">We sent an inspiration to Moses: "Travel by night with My servants, and strike a dry path for them through the sea, without fear of being overtaken (by Pharaoh) and without (any other) fear."</AYA>
		<AYA id="020078">Then Pharaoh pursued them with his forces, but the waters completely overwhelmed them and covered them up.</AYA>
		<AYA id="020079">Pharaoh led his people astray instead of leading them aright.</AYA>
		<AYA id="020080">O ye Children of Israel! We delivered you from your enemy, and We made a Covenant with you on the right side of Mount (Sinai), and We sent down to you Manna and quails:</AYA>
		<AYA id="020081">(Saying): "Eat of the good things We have provided for your sustenance, but commit no excess therein, lest My Wrath should descend on you: and those on whom descends My Wrath do perish indeed!</AYA>
		<AYA id="020082">"But, without doubt, I am (also) He that forgives again and again, to those who repent, believe, and do right, who,- in fine, are on true guidance."</AYA>
		<AYA id="020083">(When Moses was up on the Mount, Allah said:) "What made thee hasten in advance of thy people, O Moses?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="020084">He replied: "Behold, they are close on my footsteps: I hastened to Thee, O my Lord, to please Thee."</AYA>
		<AYA id="020085">(Allah) said: "We have tested thy people in thy absence: the Smir has led them astray."</AYA>
		<AYA id="020086">So Moses returned to his people in a state of anger and sorrow. He said: "O my people! did not your Lord make a handsome promise to you? Did then the promise seem to you long (in coming)? Or did ye desire that Wrath should descend from your Lord on you, and so ye broke your promise to me?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="020087">They said: "We broke not the promise to thee, as far as lay in our power: but we were made to carry the weight of the ornaments of the (whole) people, and we threw them (into the fire), and that was what the Smir suggested.</AYA>
		<AYA id="020088">"Then he brought out (of the fire) before the (people) the image of a calf: It seemed to low: so they said: 'This is your god, and the god of Moses, but (Moses) has forgotten!' "</AYA>
		<AYA id="020089">Could they not see that it could not return them a word (for answer), and that it had no power either to harm them or to do them good?</AYA>
		<AYA id="020090">Aaron had already, before this said to them: "O my people! ye are being tested in this: for verily your Lord is (Allah) Most Gracious; so follow me and obey my command."</AYA>
		<AYA id="020091">They had said: "We will not cease to worship it, we will devote ourselves to it until Moses returns to us."</AYA>
		<AYA id="020092">(Moses) said: "O Aaron! What kept thee back, when thou sawest them going wrong,</AYA>
		<AYA id="020093">"From following me? Didst thou then disobey my order?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="020094">(Aaron) replied: "O son of my mother! Seize (me) not by my beard nor by (the hair of) my head! Truly I feared lest thou shouldst say, 'Thou has caused a division among the Children of Israel, and thou didst not observe my word!' "</AYA>
		<AYA id="020095">(Moses) said: "What then is thy case, O Smir?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="020096">He replied: "I saw what they saw not: so I took a handful (of dust) from the footprint of the Messenger, and threw it (into the calf): thus did my soul suggest to me."</AYA>
		<AYA id="020097">(Moses) said: "Get thee gone! but thy (punishment) in this life will be that thou wilt say, 'Touch me not'; and moreover (for a future penalty) thou hast a promise that will not fail. Now look at thy god, of whom thou hast become a devoted worshipper: we will certainly burn it in a blazing fire and scatter it broadcast in the sea!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="020098">But the God of you all is Allah. there is no god but He: all things He comprehends in His knowledge.</AYA>
		<AYA id="020099">Thus do We relate to thee some stories of what happened before: for We have sent thee a reminder from Us.</AYA>
		<AYA id="020100">If any do turn away therefrom, verily they will bear a burden on the Day of Judgment;</AYA>
		<AYA id="020101">They will abide in this (state): and grievous will the burden be to them on that Day,-</AYA>
		<AYA id="020102">The Day when the Trumpet will be sounded: that Day, We shall gather the sinful, blear-eyed (with terror).</AYA>
		<AYA id="020103">In whispers will they consult each other: "Yet tarried not longer than ten (Days);"</AYA>
		<AYA id="020104">We know best what they will say, when the best of them in judgment will say: "Ye tarried not longer than a day!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="020105">They ask thee concerning the Mountains: say, "My Lord will uproot them and scatter them as dust;</AYA>
		<AYA id="020106">"He will leave them as plains smooth and level;</AYA>
		<AYA id="020107">"Nothing crooked or curved wilt thou see in their place."</AYA>
		<AYA id="020108">On that Day will they follow the Caller (straight): no crookedness (in) him: all the voices will be hushed to the Most Gracious: so that thou hearest not but murmuring.</AYA>
		<AYA id="020109">On that Day shall no intercession avail except for those for whom permission has been granted by the Most Gracious and whose word is acceptable to Him.</AYA>
		<AYA id="020110">He knows what is before or after or behind them: but they shall comprehend Him not.</AYA>
		<AYA id="020111">(All) faces shall be humbled before the Living, the Self-Subsisting, Eternal: hopeless indeed will be the man that carries iniquity (on his back).</AYA>
		<AYA id="020112">But he who works deeds of righteousness, and has faith, will have no fear of harm nor of any curtailment (of what is his due).</AYA>
		<AYA id="020113">Thus have We sent this down - an Arabic Quran - and explained therein in detail some of the warnings, in order that they may fear Allah, or that it may cause their remembrance (of Him).</AYA>
		<AYA id="020114">High above all is Allah, the King, the Truth! Be not in haste with the Quran before its revelation to thee is completed, but say, "O my Lord! Increase me in knowledge."</AYA>
		<AYA id="020115">We had already, beforehand, taken the covenant of Adam, but he forgot: and We found on his part no firm resolve.</AYA>
		<AYA id="020116">When We said to the angels, "Prostrate yourselves to Adam", they prostrated themselves, but not Iblis: he refused.</AYA>
		<AYA id="020117">Then We said: "O Adam! Verily, this is an enemy to thee and thy wife: so let him not get you both out of the Garden, so that thou art landed in misery.</AYA>
		<AYA id="020118">"There is therein (enough provision) for thee not to go hungry nor to go naked,</AYA>
		<AYA id="020119">"Nor to suffer from thirst, nor from the sun's heat."</AYA>
		<AYA id="020120">But Satan whispered evil to him: he said, "O Adam! shall I lead thee to the Tree of Eternity and to a kingdom that never decays?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="020121">In the result, they both ate of the tree, and so their nakedness appeared to them: they began to sew together, for their covering, leaves from the Garden: thus did Adam disobey his Lord, and fell into error.</AYA>
		<AYA id="020122">But his Lord chose him (for His Grace): He turned to him, and gave him Guidance.</AYA>
		<AYA id="020123">He said: "Get ye down, both of you,- all together, from the Garden, with enmity one to another: but if, as is sure, there comes to you Guidance from Me, whosoever follows My Guidance, will not lose his way, nor fall into misery.</AYA>
		<AYA id="020124">"But whosoever turns away from My Message, verily for him is a life narrowed down, and We shall raise him up blind on the Day of Judgment."</AYA>
		<AYA id="020125">He will say: "O my Lord! Why hast Thou raised me up blind, while I had sight (before)?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="020126">(Allah) will say: "Thus didst Thou, when Our Signs came unto thee, forgot them: so wilt thou, this day, be forgotten."</AYA>
		<AYA id="020127">And thus do We recompense him who transgresses beyond bounds and believes not in the Sings of his Lord: and the Chastisement of the Hereafter is far more grievous and more enduring.</AYA>
		<AYA id="020128">Is it not a guidance to such men (to call to mind) how many generations before them We destroyed, in whose haunts they (now) move? Verily, in this are Signs for men endued with understanding.</AYA>
		<AYA id="020129">Had it not been for a Word that went forth before from thy Lord, (their punishment) must necessarily have come; but there is a Term appointed (for respite).</AYA>
		<AYA id="020130">Therefore be patient with what they say, and celebrate (constantly) the praises of thy Lord, before the rising of the sun, and before its setting; yea, celebrate them for part of the hours of the night, and at the sides of the day: that thou may be pleased.</AYA>
		<AYA id="020131">Nor strain thine eyes in longing for the things We have given for enjoyment to parties of them, the splendor of the life of this world, through which We test them: but the provision of thy Lord is better and more enduring.</AYA>
		<AYA id="020132">Enjoin prayer on thy people, and be constant therein. We ask thee not to provide sustenance: We provide it for thee. But the (fruit of) the Hereafter is for Righteousness.</AYA>
		<AYA id="020133">They say: "Why does he not bring us a Sign from his Lord?" Has not a Clear Sign come to them of all that was in the former Books of revelation?</AYA>
		<AYA id="020134">Had We destroyed them with punishment before this, they would have said: "Our Lord! If only Thou hadst sent us a messenger, we should certainly have followed Thy Signs before we were humbled and put to shame."</AYA>
		<AYA id="020135">Say: "Each one (of us) is waiting: wait ye, therefore, and soon shall ye know who it is that is on the straight and even way, and who it is that has received Guidance."</AYA>

		<AYA id="021001">Closer and closer to mankind comes their Reckoning: yet they heed not and they turn away.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021002">Never comes (aught) to them of a renewed Message from their Lord, but they listen to it as in jest,-</AYA>
		<AYA id="021003">Their hearts toying as with trifles. The wrong-doers conceal their private counsels, (saying), "Is this (one) more than a man like yourselves? Will ye go to witchcraft with your eyes open?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="021004">Say: "My Lord knoweth (every) word (spoken) in the heavens and on earth: He is the One that heareth and knoweth (all things)."</AYA>
		<AYA id="021005">"Nay," they say, "(these are) medleys of dream! - Nay, he forged it! - Nay, he is (but) a poet! Let him then bring us a Sign like the ones that were sent to (Prophets) of old!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="021006">(As to those) before them, not one of the towns which We destroyed believed: will these believe?</AYA>
		<AYA id="021007">Before thee, also, the messengers We sent were but men, to whom We granted inspiration: If ye know this not, ask of those who possess the Message.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021008">Nor did We give them bodies that ate no food, nor were they immortals.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021009">In the end We fulfilled to them Our Promise, and We saved them and those whom We willed, but We destroyed those who transgressed beyond bounds.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021010">We have revealed for you (O men!) a book in which will give you eminence. Will ye not then understand?</AYA>
		<AYA id="021011">How many were the towns We utterly destroyed because of their iniquities, setting up in their places other peoples?</AYA>
		<AYA id="021012">Yet, when they felt Our Punishment (coming), behold, they (tried to) flee from it.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021013">Flee not, but return to the good things of this life which were given you, and to your homes in order that ye may be called to account.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021014">They said: "Ah! Woe to us! We were indeed wrong-doers!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="021015">And that cry of theirs ceased not, till We made them as a field that is mown, as ashes silent and quenched.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021016">Not for (idle) sport did We create the heavens and the earth and all that is between!</AYA>
		<AYA id="021017">If it had been Our wish to take (just) a pastime, We should surely have taken it from the things nearest to Us, if We would do (such a thing)!</AYA>
		<AYA id="021018">Nay, We hurl the Truth against falsehood, and it knocks out its brain, and behold, falsehood doth perish! Ah! Woe be to you for the (false) things ye ascribe (to Us).</AYA>
		<AYA id="021019">To Him belong all (creatures) in the heavens and on earth: even those who are with Him are not too proud to serve Him, nor are they (ever) weary (of His service):</AYA>
		<AYA id="021020">They celebrate His praises night and day, nor do they ever flag or intermit.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021021">Or have they taken (for worship) gods from the earth who can raise (the dead)?</AYA>
		<AYA id="021022">If there were, in the heavens and the earth, other gods besides Allah, there would have been ruin in both! but glory to Allah, the Lord of the Throne: (High is He) above what they attribute to Him!</AYA>
		<AYA id="021023">He cannot be questioned for His acts, but they will be questioned (for theirs).</AYA>
		<AYA id="021024">Or have they taken for worship (other) gods besides Him? Say, "Bring your convincing proof: this is the Message of those with me and the Message of those before me." But most of them know not the Truth, and so turn away.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021025">Not a messenger did We send before thee without this inspiration sent by Us to him: that there is no god but I; therefore worship and serve Me.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021026">And they say: "The Most Gracious has taken a son!" Glory to Him! They are (but) servants raised to honor.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021027">They speak not before He speaks, and they act (in all things) by His Command.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021028">He knows what is before them, and what is behind them, and they offer no intercession except for those with whom He is well pleased, and they stand in awe and reverence of His (Glory).</AYA>
		<AYA id="021029">If any of them should say, "I am a god besides Him", such a one We should reward with Hell: thus do We reward those who do wrong.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021030">Do not the Unbelievers see that the heavens and the earth were joined together (as one unit of creation), before we clove them asunder? We made from water every living thing. Will they not then believe?</AYA>
		<AYA id="021031">And We have set on the earth mountains standing firm, lest it should shake with them, and We have made therein broad highways (between mountains) for them to pass through: that they may find their way.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021032">And We have made the heavens as a canopy well guarded: yet do they turn away from the Signs which these things (point to)!</AYA>
		<AYA id="021033">It is He Who created the Night and the Day, and the sun and the moon: all (the celestial bodies) swim along, each in its rounded course.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021034">We granted not to any man before thee permanent life (here): if then thou shouldst die, would they live permanently?</AYA>
		<AYA id="021035">Every soul shall have a taste of death: and We test you by evil and by good by way of trial. To Us must ye return.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021036">When the Unbelievers see thee, they treat thee not except with ridicule. "Is this," (they say), "the one who talks of your gods?" and they blaspheme at the mention of the Most Gracious!</AYA>
		<AYA id="021037">Man is a creature of haste: soon (enough) will I show you My Signs; so ask Me not to hasten them!</AYA>
		<AYA id="021038">They say: "When will this promise come to pass, if ye are telling the truth?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="021039">If only the Unbelievers knew (the time) when they will not be able to ward off the fire from their faces, nor yet from their backs, and (when) no help can reach them!</AYA>
		<AYA id="021040">Nay, it may come to them all of a sudden and confound them: no power will they have then to avert it, nor will they (then) get respite.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021041">Mocked were (many) messengers before thee; but their scoffers were hemmed in by the thing that they mocked.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021042">Say: "Who can keep you safe by night and by day from (the Wrath of) the Most Gracious?" Yet they turn away from the mention of their Lord.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021043">Or have they gods that can guard them from Us? They have no power to aid themselves, nor can they be defended from Us.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021044">Nay, We gave the good things of this life to these men and their fathers until the period grew long for them; See they not that We gradually reduce the land (in their control) from its outlying borders? Is it then they who will win?</AYA>
		<AYA id="021045">Say, "I do but warn you according to revelation": but the deaf will not hear the call, (even) when they are warned!</AYA>
		<AYA id="021046">If but a breath of the Wrath of thy Lord do touch them, they will then say, "Woe to us! we did wrong indeed!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="021047">We shall set up scales of justice for the Day of Judgment, so that not a soul will be dealt with unjustly in the least, and if there be (no more than) the weight of a mustard seed, We will bring it (to account): and enough are We to take account.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021048">In the past We granted to Moses and Aaron the criterion (for judgment), and a Light and a Message for those who would do right,-</AYA>
		<AYA id="021049">Those who fear their Lord in their most secret thoughts, and who hold the Hour (of Judgment) in awe.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021050">And this is a blessed Message which We have sent down: will ye then reject it?</AYA>
		<AYA id="021051">We bestowed aforetime on Abraham his rectitude of conduct, and well were We acquainted with him.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021052">Behold! he said to his father and his people, "What are these images, to which ye are (so assiduously) devoted?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="021053">They said, "We found our fathers worshipping them."</AYA>
		<AYA id="021054">He said, "Indeed ye have been in manifest error - ye and your fathers."</AYA>
		<AYA id="021055">They said, "Have you brought us the Truth, or are you one of those who jest?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="021056">He said, "Nay, your Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth, He Who created them (from nothing): and I am a witness to this (Truth).</AYA>
		<AYA id="021057">"And by Allah, I will certainly plan against your idols - after ye go away and turn your backs"..</AYA>
		<AYA id="021058">So he broke them to pieces, (all) but the biggest of them, that they might turn (and address themselves) to it.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021059">They said, "Who has done this to our gods? He must indeed be one of the unjust!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="021060">They said, "We heard a youth talk of them: he is called Abraham."</AYA>
		<AYA id="021061">They said, "Then bring him before the eyes of the people, that they may bear witness."</AYA>
		<AYA id="021062">They said, "Art thou the one that did this with our gods, O Abraham?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="021063">He said: "Nay, this was done by this, the biggest one! Ask them, if they can talk!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="021064">So they turned to themselves and said, "Surely ye are the ones in the wrong!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="021065">Then were they confounded with shame: (they said), "Thou knowest full well that these (idols) do not speak!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="021066">(Abraham) said, "Do ye then worship, besides Allah, things that can neither be of any good to you nor do you harm?</AYA>
		<AYA id="021067">"Fie upon you, and upon the things that ye worship besides Allah. Have ye no sense?"..</AYA>
		<AYA id="021068">They said, "Burn him and protect your gods, If ye do (anything at all)!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="021069">We said, "O Fire! be thou cool, and (a means of) safety for Abraham!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="021070">Then they planned against him: but We made them the ones that lost most!</AYA>
		<AYA id="021071">But We delivered him and (his nephew) Lt (and directed them) to the land which We have blessed for the nations.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021072">And We bestowed on him Isaac and, as an additional gift, (a grandson), Jacob, and We made righteous men of every one (of them).</AYA>
		<AYA id="021073">And We made them leaders, guiding (men) by Our Command, and We inspired them to do good deeds, to establish regular prayers, and to give Zakat; and they constantly served Us (and Us only).</AYA>
		<AYA id="021074">And to Lt, too, We gave Judgment and Knowledge, and We saved him from the town which practiced abominations: truly they were a people given to Evil, a rebellious people.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021075">And We admitted him to Our Mercy: for he was one of the Righteous.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021076">(Remember) Noah, when he cried (to Us) aforetime: We listened to his (prayer) and delivered him and his family from great distress.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021077">We helped him against people who rejected Our Signs: truly they were a people given to Evil: so We drowned them (in the Flood) all together.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021078">And remember David and Solomon, when they gave judgment in the matter of the field into which the sheep of certain people had strayed by night: We did witness their judgment.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021079">To Solomon We inspired the (right) understanding of the matter: to each (of them) We gave Judgment and Knowledge; it was Our power that made the hills and the birds celebrate Our praises with David: it was We Who did (all these things).</AYA>
		<AYA id="021080">It was We Who taught him the making of coats of mail for your benefit, to guard you from each other's violence: will ye then be grateful?</AYA>
		<AYA id="021081">(It was Our power that made) the violent (unruly) wind flow (tamely) for Solomon, to his order, to the land which We had blessed: for We do know all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021082">And of the Satans, were some who dived for him, and did other work besides; and it was We Who guarded them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021083">And (remember) Job, when He cried to his Lord, "Truly distress has seized me, but Thou art the Most Merciful of those that are merciful."</AYA>
		<AYA id="021084">So We listened to him: We removed the distress that was on him, and We restored his people to him, and doubled their number,- as a Grace from Ourselves, and a thing for commemoration, for all who serve Us.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021085">And (remember) Ismail, Idrs, and Zulkifl, all (men) of constancy and patience;</AYA>
		<AYA id="021086">We admitted them to Our mercy: for they were of the righteous ones.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021087">And remember Zunnn, when he departed in wrath: He imagined that We had no power over him! But he cried through the depths of darkness, "There is no god but Thou: glory to Thee: I was indeed wrong!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="021088">So We listened to him: and delivered him from distress: and thus do We deliver those who have faith.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021089">And (remember) Zakariya, when he cried to his Lord: "O my Lord! leave me not without offspring, though Thou art the best of inheritors."</AYA>
		<AYA id="021090">So We listened to him: and We granted him John: We cured his wife's (barrenness) for him. These (three) were ever quick in doing in good works; they used to call on Us with yearning and awe, and humble themselves before Us.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021091">And (remember) her who guarded her chastity: We breathed into her of Our spirit, and We made her and her son a sign for all peoples.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021092">Verily, this Ummah of yours is a single Ummah, and I am your Lord and Cherisher: therefore serve Me (and no other).</AYA>
		<AYA id="021093">But (later generations) cut off their affair (of unity), one from another: (yet) will they all return to Us.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021094">Whoever works any act of righteousness and has faith,- His endeavor will not be rejected: We shall record it in his favor.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021095">But there is a ban on any population which We have destroyed: that they shall not return,</AYA>
		<AYA id="021096">Until the Gog and Magog (people) are let through (their barrier), and they swiftly swarm from every hill.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021097">Then will the true promise draw nigh (of fulfillment): then behold! the eyes of the Unbelievers will fixedly stare in horror: "Ah! Woe to us! We were indeed heedless of this; nay, we truly did wrong!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="021098">Verily ye, (unbelievers), and the (false) gods that ye worship besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell! to it will ye (surely) come!</AYA>
		<AYA id="021099">If these had been gods, they would not have got there! But each one will abide therein.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021100">There, sobbing will be their lot, nor will they there hear (aught else).</AYA>
		<AYA id="021101">Those for whom the Good from Us has gone before, will be removed far therefrom.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021102">Not the slightest soun 73d d will they hear of Hell: what their souls desired, in that will they dwell.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021103">The Great Terror will bring them no grief: but the angels will meet them (with mutual greetings): "This is your Day,- (the Day) that ye were promised."</AYA>
		<AYA id="021104">The Day that We roll up the heavens like a scroll rolled up for books (completed),- even as We produced the first creation, so shall We produce a new one: a promise We have undertaken: truly shall We fulfill it.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021105">Before this We wrote in the Psalms, after the Message (given to Moses): "My servants the righteous, shall inherit the earth."</AYA>
		<AYA id="021106">Verily in this (Qurn) is a Message for people who would (truly) worship Allah.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021107">We sent thee not, but as a Mercy for all creatures.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021108">Say: "What has come to me by inspiration is that your God is One God. will ye therefore bow to His Will (in Islm)?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="021109">But if they turn back, Say: "I have proclaimed the Message to you all alike and in truth; but I know not whether that which ye are promised is near or far.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021110">"It is He Who knows what is open in speech and what ye hide (in your hearts).</AYA>
		<AYA id="021111">"I know not but that it may be a trial for you, and a grant of (worldly) livelihood (to you) for a time."</AYA>
		<AYA id="021112">Say: "O my Lord! judge Thou in truth!" "Our Lord Most Gracious is the One Whose assistance should be sought against the blasphemies ye utter!"</AYA>

		<AYA id="022001">O mankind! fear your Lord! for the convulsion of the Hour (of Judgment) will be a thing terrible!</AYA>
		<AYA id="022002">The Day ye shall see it, every mother giving suck shall forget her suckling- babe, and every pregnant female shall drop her load (unformed): thou shalt see mankind as in a drunken riot, yet not drunk: but dreadful will be the Chastisement of Allah.</AYA>
		<AYA id="022003">And yet among men there are such as dispute about Allah, without knowledge, and follow every evil one obstinate in rebellion!</AYA>
		<AYA id="022004">About the (Satan) it is decreed that whoever turns to him for friendship, him will he lead astray, and he will guide him to the Chastisement of the Fire.</AYA>
		<AYA id="022005">O mankind! if ye have a doubt about the Resurrection, (consider) that We created you out of dust, then out of sperm, then out of a leech-like clot, then out of a morsel of flesh, partly formed and partly unformed, in order that We may manifest (Our power) to you; and We cause whom We will to rest in the wombs for an appointed term, then do We bring you out as babes, then (foster you) that ye may reach your age of full strength; and some of you are called to die, and some are sent back to the feeblest old age, so that they know nothing after having known (much), and (further), thou seest the earth barren and lifeless, but when We pour down rain on it, it is stirred (to life), it swells, and it puts forth every kind of beautiful growth (in pairs).</AYA>
		<AYA id="022006">This is so, because Allah is the Reality: it is He Who gives life to the dead, and it is He Who has power over all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="022007">And verily the Hour will come: there can be no doubt about it, or about (the fact) that Allah will raise up all who are in the graves.</AYA>
		<AYA id="022008">Yet there is among men such a one as disputes about Allah, without knowledge, without guidance, and without a Book of Enlightenment,-</AYA>
		<AYA id="022009">(Disdainfully) bending his side, in order to lead (men) astray from the Path of Allah. for him there is disgrace in this life, and on the Day of Judgment We shall make him taste the Chastisement of burning (Fire).</AYA>
		<AYA id="022010">(It will be said): "This is because of the deeds which thy hands sent forth, for verily Allah is not unjust to His servants."</AYA>
		<AYA id="022011">There are among men some who serve Allah, as it were, on the verge: if good befalls them, they are, therewith, well content; but if a trial comes to them, they turn on their faces: they lose both this world and the Hereafter: that in indeed a manifest loss!</AYA>
		<AYA id="022012">They call on such deities, besides Allah, as can neither hurt nor profit them: that is straying far indeed (from the Way)!</AYA>
		<AYA id="022013">(Perhaps) they call on one whose hurt is nearer than his profit: evil, indeed, is the patron, and evil the companion (or help)!</AYA>
		<AYA id="022014">Verily Allah will admit those who believe and work righteous deeds, to Gardens, beneath which rivers flow: for Allah carries out all that He desires.</AYA>
		<AYA id="022015">If any think that Allah will not help him (His Messenger), in this world and the Hereafter, let him stretch out a rope to the ceiling and cut (himself) off: then let him see whether his plan will remove that which enrages (him)!</AYA>
		<AYA id="022016">Thus have We sent down Clear Sings; and verily Allah doth guide whom He will!</AYA>
		<AYA id="022017">Those who believe (in the Quran), those who follow the Jewish (scriptures), and the Sabians, Christians, Magians, and Polytheists,- Allah will judge between them on the Day of Judgment: for Allah is witness of all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="022018">Seest thou not that to Allah prostrate all things that are in the heavens and on earth,- the sun, the moon, the stars; the hills, the trees, the animals; and a great number among mankind? But a great number are (also) such as unto whom the Chastisement is justly due, and such as Allah shall disgrace,- None can raise to honor: for Allah carries out all that He wills.</AYA>
		<AYA id="022019">These two antagonists dispute with each other about their Lord: but those who deny (their Lord),- for them will be cut out a garment of Fire: over their heads will be poured out boiling water.</AYA>
		<AYA id="022020">With it will be melted what is within their bodies, as well as (their) skins.</AYA>
		<AYA id="022021">In addition there will be maces of iron (to punish) them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="022022">Every time they wish to get away therefrom, from anguish, they will be forced back therein, and (it will be said), "Taste ye the Chastisement of Burning!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="022023">Allah will admit those who believe and work righteous deeds, to Gardens beneath which rivers flow: they shall be adorned therein with bracelets of gold and pearls; and their garments there will be of silk.</AYA>
		<AYA id="022024">For they have been guided (in this life) to the purest of speeches; they have been guided to the Path of Him Who is Worthy of (all) Praise.</AYA>
		<AYA id="022025">As to those who have rejected (Allah), and would keep back (men) from the Way of Allah, and from the Sacred Mosque, which We have made (open) to (all) men - equal is the dweller there and the visitor from the country - and any whose purpose therein is profanity or wrongfully - them will We cause to taste of a most Grievous Chastisement.</AYA>
		<AYA id="022026">Behold! We pointed the site, to Abraham, of the (Sacred) House, (saying): "Associate not anything (in worship) with Me; and sanctify My House for those who compass it round, or stand up, or bow, or prostrate themselves (therein in prayer).</AYA>
		<AYA id="022027">"And proclaim the Pilgrimage among men: they will come to thee on foot and (mounted) on every camel, lean on account of journeys through deep and distant mountain highways;</AYA>
		<AYA id="022028">"That they may witness the benefits (provided) for them, and celebrate the name of Allah, through the Days appointed, over the cattle which He has provided for them (for sacrifice): then eat ye thereof and feed the distressed ones in want.</AYA>
		<AYA id="022029">"Then let them complete the rites prescribed for them, perform their vows, and (again) circumambulate the Ancient House."</AYA>
		<AYA id="022030">Such (is the Pilgrimage): whoever honors the sacred rites of Allah, for him it is good in the Sight of his Lord. Lawful to you (for food in Pilgrimage) are cattle, except those mentioned to you (as exception): so shun the abomination of idols, and shun the word that is false,-</AYA>
		<AYA id="022031">Being true in faith to Allah, and never assigning partners to Him: if anyone assigns partners to Allah, he is as if he had fallen from heaven and been snatched up by birds, or the wind had swooped (like a bird on its prey) and thrown him into a far-distant place.</AYA>
		<AYA id="022032">Such (is his state): and whoever holds in honor the rites of Allah, (in the sacrifice of animals), such (honor) should come truly from piety of heart.</AYA>
		<AYA id="022033">In them ye have benefits for a term appointed: in the end their place of sacrifice is near the Ancient House.</AYA>
		<AYA id="022034">To every people did We appoint rites (of sacrifice), that they might celebrate the name of Allah over the sustenance He gave them from animals (fit for food). But your God is One God. submit then your wills to Him (in Islm): and give thou the good news to those who humble themselves,-</AYA>
		<AYA id="022035">To those whose hearts when Allah is mentioned, are filled with fear, who show patient perseverance over their afflictions, keep up regular prayer, and spend (in charity) out of what We have bestowed upon them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="022036">The sacrificial camels we have made for you as among the signs from Allah: in them is (much) good for you: then pronounce the name of Allah over them as they line up (for sacrifice): when they are down on their sides (after slaughter), eat ye thereof, and feed such as (beg not but) live in contentment, and such as beg with due humility: thus have We made animals subject to you, that ye may be grateful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="022037">It is not their meat nor their blood, that reaches Allah, it is your piety that reaches Him: He has thus made them subject to you, that ye may glorify Allah for His Guidance to you and proclaim the good news to all who do good.</AYA>
		<AYA id="022038">Verily Allah will defend (from ill) those who believe: verily, Allah loveth not any that is unfaithful, ungrateful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="022039">To those against whom war is made, permission is given (to fight), because they are wronged;- and verily, Allah is most powerful for their aid;-</AYA>
		<AYA id="022040">(They are) those who have been expelled from their homes in defiance of right,- (for no cause) except that they say, "Our Lord is Allah". Did not Allah check one set of people by means of another, there would surely have been pulled down monasteries, churches, synagogues, and mosques, in which the name of Allah is commemorated in abundant measure. Allah will certainly aid those who aid his (cause);- for verily Allah is full of Strength, Exalted in Might, (able to enforce His Will).</AYA>
		<AYA id="022041">(They are) those who, if We establish them in the land, establish regular prayer and give Zakat, enjoin the right and forbid wrong: with Allah rests the end (and decision) of (all) affairs.</AYA>
		<AYA id="022042">If they disbelieve you, so did the peoples before them (with their prophets),- the People of Noah, and d and Thamd;</AYA>
		<AYA id="022043">And those of Abraham and Lt;</AYA>
		<AYA id="022044">And the Companions of the Madyan people; and Moses was rejected (in the same way). But I granted respite to the Unbelievers, and (only) after that did I punish them: but how (terrible) was My punishment (of them)!</AYA>
		<AYA id="022045">How many populations have We destroyed, which were given to wrong- doing? They tumbled down on their roofs. And how many wells are lying idle and neglected, and castles lofty and well-built?</AYA>
		<AYA id="022046">Do they not travel through the land, so that their hearts (and minds) may thus learn wisdom and their ears may thus learn to hear? Truly it is not their eyes that are blind, but the hearts which are in their breasts.</AYA>
		<AYA id="022047">Yet they ask thee to hasten on the Punishment! But Allah will not fail in His Promise. Verily a Day in the sight of thy Lord is like a thousand years of your reckoning.</AYA>
		<AYA id="022048">And to how many populations did I give respite, which were given to wrong- doing? In the end I punished them. To me is the destination (of all).</AYA>
		<AYA id="022049">Say: "O men! I am (sent) to you only to give a Clear Warning:</AYA>
		<AYA id="022050">"Those who believe and work righteousness, for them is forgiveness and a sustenance most generous.</AYA>
		<AYA id="022051">"But those who strive against Our Signs, to frustrate them,- they will be Companions of the Fire."</AYA>
		<AYA id="022052">Never did We send a messenger or a prophet before thee, but, when he framed a desire, Satan threw some (vanity) into his desire: but Allah will cancel anything (vain) that Satan throws in, and Allah will confirm (and establish) His Signs: for Allah is full of Knowledge and Wisdom:</AYA>
		<AYA id="022053">That He may make the suggestions thrown in by Satan, but a trial for those in whose hearts is a disease and who are hardened of heart: verily the wrong-doers are in a schism far (from the Truth):</AYA>
		<AYA id="022054">And that those on whom knowledge has been bestowed may learn that the (Qurn) is the Truth from thy Lord, and that they may believe therein, and their hearts may be made humbly (open) to it: for verily Allah is the Guide of those who believe, to the Straight Way.</AYA>
		<AYA id="022055">Those who reject Faith will not cease to be in doubt concerning (Revelation) until the Hour (of Judgment) comes suddenly upon them, or there comes to them the Chastisement of a barren Day.</AYA>
		<AYA id="022056">On that Day of Dominion will be that of Allah. He will judge between them: so those who believe and work righteous deeds will be in Gardens of Delight.</AYA>
		<AYA id="022057">And for those who reject Faith and deny Our Signs, there will be a humiliating Punishment.</AYA>
		<AYA id="022058">Those who leave their homes in the Cause of Allah, and are then slain or die,- on them will Allah bestow verily a goodly Provision. Truly Allah is He Who bestows the best provision.</AYA>
		<AYA id="022059">Verily He will admit them to a place with which they shall be well pleased: for Allah is All-Knowing, Most Forbearing.</AYA>
		<AYA id="022060">That (is so). And if one has retaliated to no greater extent than the injury he received, and is again set upon inordinately, Allah will help him: for Allah is One that blots out (sins) and forgives (again and again).</AYA>
		<AYA id="022061">That is because Allah merges night into day, and He merges day into night, and verily it is Allah Who hears and sees (all things).</AYA>
		<AYA id="022062">That is because Allah - He is the Reality; and those besides Him whom they invoke,- they are but vain Falsehood: verily Allah is He, Most High, Most Great.</AYA>
		<AYA id="022063">Seest thou not that Allah sends down rain from the sky, and forthwith the earth becomes clothed with green? For Allah is All-Subtle, All-Aware.</AYA>
		<AYA id="022064">To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and on earth: for verily Allah,- He is free of all wants, Worthy of all Praise.</AYA>
		<AYA id="022065">Seest thou not that Allah has made subject to you (men) all that is on the earth, and the ships that sail through the sea by His Command? He withholds the sky from failing on the earth except by His leave: for Allah is Most Kind and Most Merciful to man.</AYA>
		<AYA id="022066">It is He Who gave you life, will cause you to die, and will again give you life. Truly man is a most ungrateful creature!</AYA>
		<AYA id="022067">To every People have We appointed rites which they must follow: let them not then dispute with thee on the matter, but do thou invite (them) to thy Lord: for thou art assuredly on the Right Way.</AYA>
		<AYA id="022068">If they do wrangle with thee, say, "Allah knows best what it is ye are doing."</AYA>
		<AYA id="022069">"Allah will judge between you on the Day of Judgment concerning the matters in which ye differ."</AYA>
		<AYA id="022070">Knowest thou not that Allah knows all that is in heaven and on earth? Indeed it is all in a Record, and that is easy for Allah.</AYA>
		<AYA id="022071">Yet they worship, besides Allah, things for which no authority has been sent down to them, and of which they have (really) no knowledge: for those that do wrong there is no helper.</AYA>
		<AYA id="022072">When Our Clear Signs are rehearsed to them, thou wilt notice a denial on the faces of the Unbelievers! They nearly attack with violence those who rehearse Our Signs to them. Say, "Shall I tell you of something (far) worse than these Signs? It is the Fire (of Hell)! Allah has promised it to the Unbelievers! and evil is t 64c hat destination!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="022073">O men! Here is a parable set forth! Listen to it! Those on whom, besides Allah, ye call, cannot create (even) a fly, if they all met together for the purpose! And if the fly should snatch away anything from them, they would have no power to release it from the fly. Feeble are those who petition and those whom they petition!</AYA>
		<AYA id="022074">They do not have right estimate of Allah, for Allah is Powerful and Mighty.</AYA>
		<AYA id="022075">Allah chooses messengers from angels and from men, for Allah is He Who hears and sees (all things).</AYA>
		<AYA id="022076">He knows what is before them and what is behind them: and to Allah go back all questions (for decision).</AYA>
		<AYA id="022077">O ye who believe! bow down, prostrate yourselves, and adore your Lord; and do good; that ye may prosper.</AYA>
		<AYA id="022078">And strive in His cause as ye ought to strive, (with sincerity and under discipline). He has chosen you, and has imposed no difficulties on you in religion; it is the religion of your father Abraham. It is He Who has named you Muslims, both before and in this (Revelation); that the Messenger may be a witness for you, and ye be witnesses for mankind! So establish regular prayer, give Zakat, and hold fast to Allah. He is your Protector - the Best to protect and the Best to help!</AYA>

		<AYA id="023008">Those who faithfully observe their trusts and their covenants;</AYA>
		<AYA id="023009">And who (strictly) guard their prayers;-</AYA>
		<AYA id="023010">These will be the heirs,</AYA>
		<AYA id="023011">Who will inherit Paradise: they will dwell therein (for ever).</AYA>
		<AYA id="023012">Man We did create from a quintessence (of clay);</AYA>
		<AYA id="023013">Then We placed him as (a drop of) sperm in a place of rest, firmly fixed;</AYA>
		<AYA id="023014">Then We made the sperm into a clot of congealed blood; then of that clot We made a (fetus) lump; then we made out of that lump bones and clothed the bones with flesh; then We developed out of it another creature. So blessed be Allah, the best to create!</AYA>
		<AYA id="023015">After that, at length ye will die</AYA>
		<AYA id="023016">Again, on the Day of Judgment, will ye be raised up.</AYA>
		<AYA id="023017">And We have made, above you, seven tracts; and We are never unmindful of (Our) Creation.</AYA>
		<AYA id="023018">And We send down water from the sky according to (due) measure, and We cause it to soak in the soil; and We certainly are able to drain it off (with ease).</AYA>
		<AYA id="023019">With it We grow for you gardens of date-palms and vines: in them have ye abundant fruits: and of them ye eat (and have enjoyment),-</AYA>
		<AYA id="023020">Also a tree springing out of Mount Sinai, which produces oil, and relish for those who use it for food.</AYA>
		<AYA id="023021">And in cattle (too) ye have an instructive example: from within their bodies We produce (milk) for you to drink; there are, in them, (besides), numerous (other) benefits for you; and of their (meat) ye eat;</AYA>
		<AYA id="023022">An on them, as well as in ships, ye ride.</AYA>
		<AYA id="023023">And certainly We sent Noah to his people: He said, "O my people! Worship Allah. Ye have no other god but Him. Will ye not fear (Him)?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="023024">The chiefs of the Unbelievers among his people said: "He is no more than a man like yourselves: his wish is to assert his superiority over you: if Allah had wished (to send messengers), He could have sent down angels; never did we hear such a thing (as he says), among our ancestors of old."</AYA>
		<AYA id="023025">(And some said): "He is only a man possessed: wait (and have patience) with him for a time."</AYA>
		<AYA id="023026">(Noah) said: "O my Lord! help me: for that they accuse me of falsehood!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="023027">So We inspired him (with this message): "Construct the Ark within Our sight and under Our guidance: then when comes Our Command, and the over gushes forth, take thou on board pairs of every species, male and female, and thy family- except those of them against whom the Word has already gone forth: and address Me not in favor of the wrong-doers; for they shall be drowned (in the Flood).</AYA>
		<AYA id="023028">And when thou hast embarked on the Ark - thou and those with thee,- say: "Praise be to Allah, Who has saved us from the people who do wrong."</AYA>
		<AYA id="023029">And say: "O my Lord! Enable me to disembark with thy blessing: for Thou art the Best to enable (us) to disembark."</AYA>
		<AYA id="023030">Verily in this there are Signs (for men to understand); lo! We put men to test.</AYA>
		<AYA id="023031">Then We raised after them another generation.</AYA>
		<AYA id="023032">And We sent to them a messenger from among themselves, (saying), "Worship Allah. ye have no other god but Him. Will ye not fear (Him)?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="023033">And the chiefs of his people, who disbelieved and denied the Meeting in the Hereafter, and on whom We had bestowed the good things of this life, said: "He is no more than a man like yourselves: he eats of that of which ye eat, and drinks of what ye drink.</AYA>
		<AYA id="023034">"If ye obey a man like yourselves, behold, it is certain ye will be lost.</AYA>

		<AYA id="023040">(Allah) said: "In but a little while, they are sure to be sorry!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="023041">Then the Blast overtook them with justice, and We made them as rubbish of dead leaves. So away with the people who do wrong!</AYA>
		<AYA id="023042">Then We raised after them other generations.</AYA>
		<AYA id="023043">No people can hasten their term, nor can they delay (it).</AYA>
		<AYA id="023044">Then sent We Our messengers in succession: every time there came to a people their messenger, they accused him of falsehood: so We made them follow each other (in punishment): We made them as a tale (that is told)! So away with a people that will not believe!</AYA>
		<AYA id="023045">Then We sent Moses and his brother Aaron, with Our Signs and authority manifest,</AYA>
		<AYA id="023046">To Pharaoh and his Chiefs: but these behaved insolently: they were an arrogant people.</AYA>
		<AYA id="023047">They said: "Shall we believe in two men like ourselves? And their people are subject to us!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="023048">So they rejected them, and they became of those who were destroyed.</AYA>
		<AYA id="023049">And We gave Moses the Book, in order that they might receive guidance.</AYA>
		<AYA id="023050">And We made the son of Mary and his mother as a Sign: We gave them both shelter on high ground, affording rest and security and furnished with springs.</AYA>
		<AYA id="023051">O ye messengers! Enjoy (all) things good and pure, and work righteousness: for I am well-acquainted with (all) that ye do.</AYA>
		<AYA id="023052">And verily this Ummah of yours is a single Ummah, and I am your Lord and Cherisher: therefore fear Me (and no other).</AYA>
		<AYA id="023053">But people have cut off their affair (of unity), between them, into sects: each party rejoices in that which is with itself.</AYA>
		<AYA id="023054">But leave them in their confused ignorance for a time.</AYA>
		<AYA id="023055">Do they think that because We have granted them abundance of wealth and sons,</AYA>
		<AYA id="023056">We would hasten them on in every good? Nay, they do not perceive.</AYA>
		<AYA id="023057">Verily those who live in awe for fear of their Lord;</AYA>
		<AYA id="023058">Those who believe in the Signs of their Lord;</AYA>
		<AYA id="023059">Those who join not (in worship) partners with their Lord;</AYA>
		<AYA id="023060">And those who dispense their charity with their hearts full of fear, because they will return to their Lord;-</AYA>
		<AYA id="023061">It is these who hasten in every good work, and these who are foremost in them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="023062">On no soul do We place a burden greater than it can bear: before Us is a record which clearly speaks the truth: they will never be wronged.</AYA>
		<AYA id="023063">But their hearts are in confused ignorance of this; and there are, besides that, deeds of theirs, which they will (continue) to do,-</AYA>
		<AYA id="023064">Until, when We seize in Punishment those of them who received the good things of this world, behold, they will groan in supplication!</AYA>
		<AYA id="023065">(It will be said): "Groan not in supplication this day: for ye shall certainly not be helped by Us.</AYA>
		<AYA id="023066">"My Signs used to be rehearsed to you, but ye used to turn back on your heels-</AYA>
		<AYA id="023067">"In arrogance: talking nonsense about the (Qurn), like one telling fables by night."</AYA>
		<AYA id="023068">Do they not ponder over the Word (of Allah), or has anything (new) come to them that did not come to their fathers of old?</AYA>
		<AYA id="023069">Or do they not recognize their Messenger, that they deny him?</AYA>
		<AYA id="023070">Or do they say, "He is possessed"? Nay, he has brought them the Truth, but most of them hate the Truth.</AYA>
		<AYA id="023071">If the Truth had been in accord with their desires, truly the heavens and the earth, and all beings therein would have been in ruin! Nay, We have sent them their admonition, but they turn away from their admonition.</AYA>
		<AYA id="023072">Or is it that thou askest them for some recompense? But the recompense of thy Lord is best: He is the Best of those who give sustenance.</AYA>
		<AYA id="023073">But verily thou callest them to the Straight Way;</AYA>
		<AYA id="023074">And verily those who believe not in the Hereafter are deviating from that Way.</AYA>
		<AYA id="023075">If We had mercy on them and removed the distress which is on them, they would obstinately persist in their transgression, wandering in distraction to and fro.</AYA>
		<AYA id="023076">We inflicted Punishment on them, but they humbled not themselves to their Lord, nor do they submissively entreat (Him)!-</AYA>
		<AYA id="023077">Until We open on them a gate leading to a severe Punishment: then lo! they will be plunged in despair therein!</AYA>
		<AYA id="023078">It is He Who has created for you (the faculties of) hearing, sight, feeling and understanding: little thanks it is ye give!</AYA>
		<AYA id="023079">And He has multiplied you through the earth, and to Him shall ye be gathered back.</AYA>
		<AYA id="023080">It is He Who gives life and death, and to Him (is due) the alternation of Night and Day: will ye not then understand?</AYA>
		<AYA id="023081">On the contrary they say things similar to what the ancients said.</AYA>
		<AYA id="023082">They say: "What! When we die and become dust and bones, could we really be raised up again?</AYA>
		<AYA id="023083">"Such things have been promised to us and to our fathers before! they are nothing but tales of the ancients!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="023084">Say: "To whom belong the earth and all beings therein? (Say) if ye know!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="023085">They will say, "To Allah." Say: "Yet will ye not receive admonition?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="023086">Say: "Who is the Lord of the seven heavens, and the Lord of the Mighty Throne?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="023087">They will say, "(They belong) to Allah." Say: "Will ye not then fear?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="023088">Say: "Who is it in whose hands is the sovereignty of all things,- who protects (all), but is not protected (of any)? (Say) if ye know."</AYA>

		<AYA id="023090">We have sent them the Truth: but they indeed are liars!</AYA>
		<AYA id="023091">No son did Allah beget, nor is there any god along with Him: (if there were many gods), behold, each god would have taken away what he had created, and some would have lorded it over others! Glory to Allah. (He is free) from the (sort of) things they attribute to Him!</AYA>

		<AYA id="023101">Then when the Trumpet is blown, there will be no more relationships between them that Day, nor will one ask after another!</AYA>
		<AYA id="023102">Then those whose balance (of good deeds) is heavy,- they will be successful:</AYA>
		<AYA id="023103">But those whose balance is light, will be those who have lost their souls, in Hell will they abide.</AYA>
		<AYA id="023104">The Fire will burn their faces, and they will therein grin, with their lips displaced.</AYA>
		<AYA id="023105">"Were not My Signs rehearsed to you, and ye did but treat them as falsehood?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="023106">They will say: "Our Lord! Our misfortune overwhelmed us, and we became a people astray!</AYA>
		<AYA id="023107">"Our Lord! Bring us out of this: if ever we return (to evil), then shall we be wrong-doers indeed!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="023108">He will say: "Be ye driven into it (with ignominy)! And speak ye not to Me!</AYA>
		<AYA id="023109">"A part of My servants there was, who used to pray 'Our Lord! We believe; then do Thou forgive us, and have mercy upon us: for Thou art the Best of those who show mercy!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="023110">"But ye treated them with ridicule, so much so that (ridicule of) them made you forget My Message while ye were laughing at them!</AYA>
		<AYA id="023111">"I have rewarded them this day for their patience and constancy: they are indeed the ones that have achieved Bliss..."</AYA>
		<AYA id="023112">He will say: "What number of years did ye stay on earth?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="023113">They will say: "We stayed a day or part of a day: but ask those who keep account."</AYA>
		<AYA id="023114">He will say: "Ye stayed not but a little,- if ye had only known!</AYA>
		<AYA id="023115">"Did ye then think that We had created you in jest, and that ye would not be brought back to Us (for account)?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="023116">Therefore exalted be Allah, the King, the Reality: there is no god but He, the Lord of the Throne of Honor!</AYA>
		<AYA id="023117">If anyone invokes, besides Allah, any other god, he has no authority therefor; and his reckoning will be only with his Lord! And verily the Unbelievers shall not prosper!</AYA>
		<AYA id="023118">So say: "O my Lord! Grant Thou forgiveness and mercy, for Thou art the Best of those who show mercy!"</AYA>

	<SOURA id="24" name="The Light">
		<AYA id="024001">A Srah which We have sent down and which We have ordained. In it have We sent down Clear Signs, in order that ye may receive admonition.</AYA>
		<AYA id="024002">The woman and the man guilty of fornication,- flog each of them with a hundred stripes. Let not compassion move you in their case, in a matter prescribed by Allah, if ye believe in Allah and the Last Day: and let a party of the Believers witness their punishment.</AYA>
		<AYA id="024003">The adulterer cannot have sexual relations with any but an adulteress, or idolatress. And the adulteress, none can have sexual relations with her but an adulterer or an idolater: to the Believers such a thing is forbidden.</AYA>
		<AYA id="024004">And those who launch a charge against chaste women, and produce not four witnesses (to support their allegations),- flog them with eighty stripes; and reject their evidence ever after: for such men are wicked transgressors;-</AYA>
		<AYA id="024005">Except those who repent thereafter and mend (their conduct); for Allah is Oft- Forgiving, Most Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="024006">And for those who launch a charge against their wives, and have (in support) no evidence but their own,- let one of them testify four times by Allah that he is of those who speak the truth;</AYA>
		<AYA id="024007">And the fifth (oath) (should be) that he solemnly invoke the curse of Allah on himself if he tell a lie.</AYA>
		<AYA id="024008">But it would avert the punishment from the wife, if she bears witness four times (with an oath) By Allah, that (her husband) is telling a lie;</AYA>
		<AYA id="024009">And the fifth (oath) should be that she solemnly invokes the wrath of Allah on herself if (her accuser) is telling the truth.</AYA>
		<AYA id="024010">If it were not for Allah's grace and mercy on you, and that Allah is Oft- Returning, full of Wisdom,- (ye would be ruined indeed).</AYA>
		<AYA id="024011">Those who brought forward the lie are a body among yourselves: think it not to be an evil to you; on the contrary it is good for you: to every man among them (will come the punishment) of the sin that he earned, and to him who took on himself the lead among them, will be a chastisement grievous.</AYA>
		<AYA id="024012">Why did not the believers - men and women - when ye heard of the affair,- though well of their people and say, "This (charge) is an obvious lie" ?</AYA>
		<AYA id="024013">Why did they not bring four witnesses to prove it? When they have not brought the witnesses, such men, in the sight of Allah, (stand forth) themselves as liars!</AYA>
		<AYA id="024014">Were it not for the grace and mercy of Allah on you, in this world and the Hereafter, a grievous chastisement would have seized you in that ye rushed glibly into this affair.</AYA>
		<AYA id="024015">Behold, ye received it on your tongues, and said out of your mouths things of which ye had no knowledge; and ye thought it to be a light matter, while it was most serious in the sight of Allah.</AYA>
		<AYA id="024016">And why did ye not, when ye heard it, say? - "It is not right of us to speak of this: Glory to Thee (our Lord), this is a most serious slander!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="024017">Allah doth admonish you, that ye may never repeat such (conduct), if ye are (true) Believers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="024018">And Allah makes the Signs plain to you: for Allah is full of knowledge and wisdom.</AYA>
		<AYA id="024019">Those who love (to see) scandal circulate among the Believers, will have a grievous chastisement in this life and in the Hereafter: Allah knows, and ye know not.</AYA>
		<AYA id="024020">Were it not for the grace and mercy of Allah on you, and that Allah is full of kindness and mercy, (ye would be ruined indeed).</AYA>
		<AYA id="024021">O ye who believe! Follow not Satan's footsteps: if any will follow the footsteps of Satan, he will (but) command what is indecent and wrong: and were it not for the grace and mercy of Allah on you, not one of you would ever have been pure: but Allah doth purify whom He pleases: and Allah is One Who hears and knows (all things).</AYA>
		<AYA id="024022">Let not those among you who are endued with grace and amplitude of means resolve by oath against helping their kinsmen, those in want, and those who have left their homes in Allah's cause: let them forgive and overlook, do you not wish that Allah should forgive you? For Allah is Oft- Forgiving, Most Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="024023">Those who slander chaste, indiscreet, and believing women, are cursed in this life and in the Hereafter: for them is a grievous chastisement,-</AYA>
		<AYA id="024024">On the Day when their tongues, their hands, and their feet will bear witness against them as to their actions.</AYA>
		<AYA id="024025">On that Day Allah will pay them back (all) their just dues, and they will realize that Allah is the (very) Truth, that makes all things manifest.</AYA>
		<AYA id="024026">Women impure are for men impure, and men impure for women impure and women of purity are for men of purity, and men of purity are for women of purity: these are innocent of all what people say: for them there is forgiveness, and a provision honorable.</AYA>
		<AYA id="024027">O ye who believe! Enter not houses other than your own, until ye have asked permission and saluted those in them: that is best for you, in order that ye may heed (what is seemly).</AYA>
		<AYA id="024028">If ye find no one in the house, enter not until permission is given to you: if ye are asked to go back, go back: that makes for greater purity for yourselves: and Allah knows well all that ye do.</AYA>
		<AYA id="024029">It is no fault on your part to enter houses not used for living in, which serve some (other) use for you: and Allah has knowledge of what ye reveal and what ye conceal.</AYA>
		<AYA id="024030">Say to the believing men that they should lower their gaze and guard their modesty: that will make for greater purity for them: and Allah is well acquainted with all that they do.</AYA>
		<AYA id="024031">And say to the believing women that they should lower their gaze and guard their modesty; that they should not display their beauty and ornaments except what (ordinarily) appear thereof; that they should draw their veils over their bosoms and not display their beauty except to their husbands, their fathers, their husband's fathers, their sons, their husbands' sons, their brothers or their brothers' sons, or their sisters' sons, or their women, or the slaves whom their right hands possess, or male attendants free of sexual desires, or small children who have no carnal of women; and that they should not strike their feet in order to draw attention to their hidden ornaments. And O ye Believers! turn ye all together towards Allah in repentance, that ye may be successful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="024032">Marry those among you who are single, or the virtuous ones among yourselves, male or female: if they are in poverty, Allah will give them means out of His grace: for Allah Ample-giving, and He knoweth all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="024033">Let those who find not the wherewithal for marriage keep themselves chaste, until Allah gives them means out of His grace. And if any of your slaves ask for a deed in writing (for emancipation), give them such a deed if ye know any good in them: yea, give them something yourselves out of the means which Allah has given to you. But force not your maids to prostitution when they desire chastity, in order that ye may make a gain in the goods of this life. But if anyone compels them, yet, after such compulsion, is Allah, Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful (to them),</AYA>
		<AYA id="024034">We have already sent down to you verses making things clear, an illustration from (the story of) people who passed away before you, and an admonition for those who fear (Allah).</AYA>
		<AYA id="024035">Allah is the Light of the heavens and the earth. The Parable of His Light is as if there were a Niche and within it a Lamp: the Lamp enclosed in Glass: the glass as it were a brilliant star: lit from a blessed Tree, an Olive, neither of the east nor of the west, whose oil is well-nigh luminous, though fire scarce touched it: Light upon Light! Allah doth guide whom He will to His Light: Allah doth set forth Parables for men: and Allah doth know all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="024036">(Lit is such a Light) in houses, which Allah hath permitted to be raised to honor; for the celebration, in them, of His name. In them is He glorified in the mornings and in the evenings, (again and again),-</AYA>
		<AYA id="024037">By men whom neither trade nor sale can divert from the Remembrance of Allah, nor from regular prayer, nor from paying Zakat: Their (only) fear is for the Day when hearts and eyes will be turned about,-</AYA>
		<AYA id="024038">That Allah may reward them according to the best of their deeds, and add even more for them out of His Grace: for Allah doth provide for those whom He will, without measure.</AYA>
		<AYA id="024039">But the Unbelievers,- their deeds are like a mirage in sandy deserts, which the man parched with thirst mistakes for water; until when he comes up to it, he finds it to be nothing: but he finds Allah there, and Allah will pay him his account: and Allah is swift in taking account.</AYA>
		<AYA id="024040">Or (the Unbelievers' state) is like the depths of darkness in a vast deep ocean, overwhelmed with billow topped by billow, topped by (dark) clouds: depths of darkness, one above another: if a man stretches out his hands, he can hardly see it! For any to whom Allah giveth not light, there is no light!</AYA>
		<AYA id="024041">Seest thou not that it is Allah Whose praises all beings in the heavens and on earth do celebrate, and the birds (of the air) with wings outspread? Each one knows its own (mode of) prayer and praise. And Allah knows well all that they do.</AYA>
		<AYA id="024042">Yea, to Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth; and to Allah is the return.</AYA>
		<AYA id="024043">Seest thou not that Allah makes the clouds move gently, then joins them together, then makes them into a heap? - then wilt thou see rain issue forth from their midst. And He sends down from the sky mountain masses (of clouds) wherein is hail: He strikes therewith whom He pleases and He turns it away from whom He pleases, the vivid flash of its lightning well-nigh blinds the sight.</AYA>
		<AYA id="024044">It is Allah Who alternates the Night and the Day: verily in these things is an instructive example for those who have vision!</AYA>
		<AYA id="024045">And Allah has created every animal from water: of them there are some that creep on their bellies; some that walk on two legs; and some that walk on four. Allah creates what He wills: for verily Allah has power over all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="024046">We have indeed sent down signs that make things manifest: and Allah guides whom He wills to a way that is straight.</AYA>
		<AYA id="024047">They say, "We believe in Allah and in the messenger, and we obey": but even after that, some of them turn away: they are not (really) Believers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="024048">When they are summoned to Allah and His messenger, in order that He may judge between them, behold some of them decline (to come).</AYA>
		<AYA id="024049">But if the right is on their side, they come to him with all submission.</AYA>
		<AYA id="024050">Is it that there is a disease in their hearts? Or do they doubt, or are they in fear, that Allah and His Messenger will deal unjustly with them? Nay, it is they themselves who do wrong.</AYA>
		<AYA id="024051">The answer of the Believers, when summoned to Allah and His Messenger, in order that he may judge between them, is no other than this: they say, "We hear and we obey": it is such as these that will prosper.</AYA>
		<AYA id="024052">It is such as obey Allah and His Messenger, and fear Allah and do right, that will triumph,</AYA>
		<AYA id="024053">They swear their strongest oaths by Allah that, if only thou wouldst command them, they would leave (their homes). Say: "Swear ye not; obedience is (more) reasonable; verily, Allah is well acquainted with all that ye do."</AYA>
		<AYA id="024054">Say: "Obey Allah, and obey the Messenger. but if ye turn away, he is only responsible for the duty placed on him and ye for that placed on you. If ye obey him, ye shall be on right guidance. The Messenger's duty is only to preach the clear (Message).</AYA>
		<AYA id="024055">Allah has promised, to those among you who believe and work righteous deeds, that He will, of a surety, grant them in the land, inheritance (of power), as He granted it to those before them; that He will establish in authority their religion - the one which He has chosen for them; and that He will change (their state), after the fear in which they (lived), to one of security and peace: 'They will worship Me (alone) and not associate aught with Me.' If any do reject Faith after this, they are rebellious and wicked.</AYA>
		<AYA id="024056">So establish regular prayer and give Zakat; and obey the Messenger. that ye may receive mercy.</AYA>
		<AYA id="024057">Never think thou that the Unbelievers can escape in the earth: their abode is the Fire,- and it is indeed an evil refuge!</AYA>
		<AYA id="024058">O ye who believe! Let those whom your right hands possess, and the (children) among you who have not come of age ask your permission (before they come to your presence), on three occasions: before morning prayer; the while ye doff your clothes for the noonday heat; and after the late- night prayer: these are your three times of undress: outside those times it is not wrong for you or for them to move about attending to each other. Thus does Allah make clear the Signs to you: for Allah is full of knowledge and wisdom.</AYA>
		<AYA id="024059">But when the children among you come of age, let them (also) ask for permission, as do those senior to them (in age). Thus does Allah make clear His Signs to you: for Allah is full of knowledge and wisdom.</AYA>
		<AYA id="024060">Such elderly women as are past the prospect of marriage,- there is no blame on them if they lay aside their (outer) garments, provided they make not a wanton display of their beauty: but it is best for them to be modest: and Allah is One Who sees and knows all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="024061">It is no fault in the blind nor in one born lame, nor in one afflicted with illness, nor in yourselves, that ye should eat in your own houses, or those of your fathers, or your mothers, or your brothers, or your sisters, or your father's brothers or your father's sisters, or your mother's brothers, or your mother's sisters, or in houses of which the keys are in your possession, or in the house of a sincere friend of yours: there is no blame on you, whether ye eat in company or separately. But if ye enter houses, salute each other - a greeting of blessing and purity as from Allah. Thus does Allah make clear the signs to you: that ye may understand.</AYA>
		<AYA id="024062">Only those are believers, who believe in Allah and His Messenger. when they are with him on a matter requiring collective action, they do not depart until they have asked for his leave; those who ask for thy leave are those who believe in Allah and His Messenger. so when they ask for thy leave, for some 3c5 business of theirs, give leave to those of them whom thou wilt, and ask Allah for their forgiveness: for Allah is Oft- Forgiving, Most Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="024063">Deem not the summons of the Messenger among yourselves like the summons of one of you to another: Allah doth know those of you who slip away under shelter of some excuse: then let those beware who withstand the Messenger's order, lest some trial befall them, or a grievous chastisement be inflicted on them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="024064">Be quite sure that to Allah doth belong whatever is in the heavens and on earth. Well doth He know what ye are intent upon: and one day they will be brought back to Him, and He will tell them the truth of what they did: for Allah doth know all things.</AYA>

		<AYA id="025001">Blessed is He Who sent down the Criterion to His servant, that it may be an admonition to all creatures;-</AYA>
		<AYA id="025002">He to Whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth: no son has He begotten, nor has He a partner in His dominion: it is He Who created all things, and ordered them in due proportions.</AYA>
		<AYA id="025003">Yet have they taken, besides him, gods that can create nothing but are themselves created; that have no control of hurt or good to themselves; nor can they control death nor life nor resurrection.</AYA>
		<AYA id="025004">But the Misbelievers say: "Naught is this but a lie which he has forged, and others have helped him at it." In truth it is they who have put forward an iniquity and a falsehood.</AYA>
		<AYA id="025005">And they say: "Tales of the ancients, which he has caused to be written: and they are dictated before him morning and evening."</AYA>

		<AYA id="025008">"Or (why) has not a treasure been bestowed on him, or why has he (not) a garden for enjoyment?" The wicked say: "Ye follow none other than a man bewitched."</AYA>
		<AYA id="025009">See what kinds of comparisons they make for thee! But they have gone astray, and never a way will they be able to find!</AYA>
		<AYA id="025010">Blessed is He Who, if that were His will, could give thee better (things) than those,- Gardens beneath which rivers flow; and He could give thee palaces (secure to dwell in).</AYA>
		<AYA id="025011">Nay they deny the Hour (of the judgment to come): but We have prepared a blazing fire for such as deny the Hour:</AYA>
		<AYA id="025012">When it sees them from a place far off, they will hear its fury and its ranging sigh.</AYA>

		<AYA id="025017">The day He will gather them together as well as those whom they worship besides Allah, He will ask: "Was it ye who led these My servants astray, or did they stray from the Path themselves?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="025018">They will say: "Glory to Thee! Not meet was it for us that we should take for protectors others besides Thee: but Thou didst bestow, on them and their fathers, good things (in life), until they forgot the Message: for they were a people destroyed."</AYA>
		<AYA id="025019">(Allah will say): "Now have they proved you liars in what ye say: so ye cannot avert (your penalty) nor (get) help." And whoever among you does wrong, him shall We cause to taste of a grievous Chastisement.</AYA>

		<AYA id="025026">That Day, the dominion right by, shall be (wholly) for the Most Gracious: it will be a Day of dire difficulty for the Misbelievers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="025027">The Day that the wrong-doer will bite at his hands, he will say, "Oh! Would that I had taken a (straight) path with the Messenger!</AYA>

		<AYA id="025029">"He did lead me astray from the Message (of Allah) after it had come to me! Ah! The Satan is but a traitor to man!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="025030">Then the Messenger will say: "O my Lord! Truly my people treated this Quran with neglect."</AYA>
		<AYA id="025031">Thus have We made for every prophet an enemy among the sinners: but enough is thy Lord to guide and to help.</AYA>
		<AYA id="025032">Those who reject Faith say: "Why is not the Quran revealed to him all at once? Thus (is it revealed), that We may strengthen thy heart thereby, and We have rehearsed it to thee in slow, well-arranged stages, gradually.</AYA>
		<AYA id="025033">And no question do they bring to thee but We reveal to thee the truth and the best explanation (thereof).</AYA>
		<AYA id="025034">Those who will be gathered to Hell (prone) on their faces,- they will be in an evil plight, and, as to Path, most astray.</AYA>
		<AYA id="025035">(Before this,) We sent Moses The Book, and appointed his brother Aaron with him as minister;</AYA>
		<AYA id="025036">And We command: "Go ye both, to the people who have rejected Our Signs:" And those (people) We destroyed with utter destruction.</AYA>
		<AYA id="025037">And the people of Noah,- when they rejected the messengers, We drowned them, and We made them as a Sign for mankind; and We have prepared for (all) wrong-doers a grievous Chastisement;-</AYA>
		<AYA id="025038">As also d and Thamd, and the Companions of the Rass, and many a generation between them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="025039">To each one We set forth Parables and examples; and each one We broke to utter annihilation (for their sins).</AYA>
		<AYA id="025040">And the (Unbelievers) must indeed have passed by the town on which was rained a shower of evil: did they not then see it (with their own eyes)? But they expect not to be raised again.</AYA>
		<AYA id="025041">When they see thee, they treat thee no otherwise than in mockery: "Is this the one whom Allah has sent as a messenger?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="025042">"He indeed would well-nigh have misled us from our gods, had it not been that we were constant to them!" - Soon will they know, when they see the Chastisement, who it is that is most misled in Path!</AYA>
		<AYA id="025043">Seest thou such a one as taketh for his god his own passion (or impulse)? Couldst thou be a disposer of affairs for him?</AYA>
		<AYA id="025044">Or thinkest thou that most of them listen or understand? They are only like cattle;- nay, they are farther astray from the way.</AYA>
		<AYA id="025045">Hast thou not see how thy Lord?- How He doth prolong the shadow! If He willed, He could make it stationary! Then do We make the sun its guide;</AYA>
		<AYA id="025046">Then We draw it in towards Ourselves,- a contraction by easy stages.</AYA>
		<AYA id="025047">And He it is Who makes the Night as a Robe for you, and Sleep as Repose, and makes the Day (as it were) a Resurrection.</AYA>
		<AYA id="025048">And He it is Who sends the winds as heralds of glad tidings, going before His Mercy, and We send down pure water from the sky,-</AYA>
		<AYA id="025049">That with it We may give life to a dead land, and slake the thirst of things We have created,- cattle and men in great numbers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="025050">And We have distributed the (water) amongst them, in order that they may be mindful, but most men are averse (to aught) but (rank) ingratitude.</AYA>
		<AYA id="025051">Had it been Our Will, We could have sent a warner to every town.</AYA>
		<AYA id="025052">Therefore listen not to the Unbelievers, but strive against them with the utmost strenuousness, with the (Qurn).</AYA>
		<AYA id="025053">It is He Who has let free the two bodies of flowing water: one palatable and sweet, and the other salt and bitter; yet has He made a barrier between them, a partition that is not to be passed.</AYA>
		<AYA id="025054">It is He Who has created man from water: then has He established relationships of lineage and marriage: for thy Lord has power (over all things).</AYA>
		<AYA id="025055">Yet do they worship, besides Allah, things that can neither profit them nor harm them: and the Misbeliever is a helper (of Evil), against his own Lord!</AYA>
		<AYA id="025056">But thee We only sent to give glad tidings and warning.</AYA>
		<AYA id="025057">Say: "No reward do I ask of you for it but this: that each one who will may take a (straight) Path to his Lord."</AYA>
		<AYA id="025058">And put thy trust in Him Who lives and dies not; and celebrate His praise; and enough is He to be acquainted with the faults of His servants;-</AYA>
		<AYA id="025059">He Who created the heavens and the earth and all that is between, in six days, then He established Himself on the Throne: Allah Most Gracious: ask thou, then, about Him of any acquainted (with such things).</AYA>
		<AYA id="025060">When it is said to them, "Adore ye the Most Gracious!", they say, "And what is the Most Gracious? Shall we adore that which thou commandest us?" And it increases them in aversion.</AYA>
		<AYA id="025061">Blessed is He Who made constellations in the skies, and placed therein a Lamp and a Moon giving light;</AYA>
		<AYA id="025062">And it is He Who made the Night and the Day to follow each other: for such as desire to be mindful or to show their gratitude.</AYA>
		<AYA id="025063">And the servants of (Allah) Most Gracious are those who walk on the earth in humility, and when the ignorant address them, they say, "Peace!";</AYA>
		<AYA id="025064">Those who spend the night in adoration of their Lord prostrate and standing;</AYA>
		<AYA id="025065">Those who say, "Our Lord! Avert from us the Wrath of Hell, for its Wrath is indeed an affliction grievous,-</AYA>

		<AYA id="025067">Those who, when they spend, are not extravagant and not niggardly, but hold a just (balance) between those (extremes);</AYA>
		<AYA id="025068">Those who invoke not, with Allah, any other god, nor slay such life as Allah has made sacred except for just cause, nor commit fornication; - and any that does this (not only) meets punishment.</AYA>
		<AYA id="025069">(But) the Chastisement on the Day of Judgment will be doubled to him, and he will dwell therein in ignominy,-</AYA>
		<AYA id="025070">Unless he repents, believes, and works righteous deeds, for Allah will change the evil of such  persons into good, and Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful,</AYA>
		<AYA id="025071">And whoever repents and does good has truly turned to Allah in repentance;-</AYA>
		<AYA id="025072">Those who witness no falsehood, and, if they pass by futility, they pass by it with honorable (avoidance);</AYA>
		<AYA id="025073">Those who, when they are admonished with the Signs of their Lord, droop not down at them as if they were deaf or blind;</AYA>
		<AYA id="025074">And those who pray, "Our Lord! Grant unto us wives and offspring who will be the comfort of our eyes, and give us (the grace) to lead the righteous."</AYA>
		<AYA id="025075">Those are the ones who will be rewarded with the highest place in heaven, because of their patient constancy: therein shall they be met with salutations and peace,</AYA>
		<AYA id="025076">Dwelling therein;- how beautiful an abode and place of rest!</AYA>
		<AYA id="025077">Say (to the Rejecters): "My Lord would not concern Himself with you but for your call on Him: but ye have indeed rejected (Him), and soon will come the inevitable (punishment)!"</AYA>

		<AYA id="026015">Allah said: "By no means! Proceed then, both of you, with Our Signs; We are with you, and will listen (to your call).</AYA>
		<AYA id="026016">"So go forth, both of you, to Pharaoh, and say: 'We have been sent by the Lord and Cherisher of the Worlds;</AYA>

		<AYA id="026018">(Pharaoh) said: "Did we not cherish thee as a child among us, and didst thou not stay in our midst many years of thy life?</AYA>
		<AYA id="026019">"And thou didst a deed of thine which (thou knowest) thou didst, and thou art an ungrateful!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="026020">Moses said: "I did it then, when I was in error.</AYA>
		<AYA id="026021">"So I fled from you (all) when I feared you; but my Lord has (since) invested me with judgment (and wisdom) and appointed me as one of the messengers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="026022">"And this is the favor with which thou dost reproach me,- that thou hast enslaved the Children of Israel!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="026023">Pharaoh said: "And what is the 'Lord and Cherisher of the Worlds'?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="026024">(Moses) said: "The Lord and Cherisher of the heavens and the earth, and all between,- if ye but sure belief."</AYA>
		<AYA id="026025">(Pharaoh) said to those around: "Did ye not listen (to what he says)?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="026026">(Moses) said: "Your Lord and the Lord of your fathers from the beginning!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="026027">(Pharaoh) said: "Truly your messenger who has been sent to you is a veritable madman!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="026028">(Moses) said: "Lord of the East and the West, and all between! If ye only had sense!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="026029">(Pharaoh) said: "If thou takest any god other than me, I will certainly put thee in prison!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="026030">(Moses) said: "Even if I showed you something clear (and) convincing?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="026031">(Pharaoh) said: "Show it then, if thou tellest the truth!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="026032">So (Moses) threw his rod, and behold, it was a serpent, plain (for all to see)!</AYA>
		<AYA id="026033">And he drew out his hand, and behold, it was white to all beholders!</AYA>
		<AYA id="026034">(Pharaoh) said to the Chiefs around him: "This is indeed a sorcerer well- versed:</AYA>
		<AYA id="026035">"His plan is to get you out of your land by his sorcery; then what is it ye counsel?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="026036">They said: "Keep him and his brother in suspense (for a while), and dispatch to the Cities heralds to collect-</AYA>
		<AYA id="026037">"And bring up to thee all (our) sorcerers well-versed."</AYA>
		<AYA id="026038">So the sorcerers were got together for the appointment of a day well-known,</AYA>
		<AYA id="026039">And the people were told: "Are ye (now) assembled?-</AYA>
		<AYA id="026040">"That we may follow the sorcerers if they win?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="026041">So when the sorcerers arrived, they said to Pharaoh: "Of course - shall we have a (suitable) reward if we win?</AYA>
		<AYA id="026042">He said: "Yea, (and more),- for ye shall in that case be (raised to posts) nearest (to my person)."</AYA>
		<AYA id="026043">Moses said to them: "Throw ye - that which ye are about to throw!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="026044">So they threw their ropes and their rods, and said: "By the might of Pharaoh, it is we who will certainly win!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="026045">Then Moses threw his rod, when, behold, it straightway swallows up all the falsehoods which they fake!</AYA>
		<AYA id="026046">Then did the sorcerers fall down, prostrate in adoration,</AYA>
		<AYA id="026047">Saying: "We believe in the Lord of the Worlds,</AYA>
		<AYA id="026048">"The Lord of Moses and Aaron."</AYA>
		<AYA id="026049">Said (Pharaoh): "Believe ye in Him before I give you permission? Surely he is your leader, who has taught you sorcery! But soon shall ye know! Be sure I will cut off your hands and your feet on opposite sides, and I will crucify you all!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="026050">They said: "No matter! For us, we shall but return to our Lord!</AYA>
		<AYA id="026051">"Only, our desire is that our Lord will forgive us our faults, since we are the first to believe"</AYA>
		<AYA id="026052">By inspiration We told Moses: "Travel by night with My servants; for surely ye shall be pursued."</AYA>
		<AYA id="026053">Then Pharaoh sent heralds to (all) the Cities,</AYA>

		<AYA id="026056">"And we are a multitude amply fore-warned."</AYA>
		<AYA id="026057">So We expelled them from gardens, springs,</AYA>
		<AYA id="026058">Treasures, and every kind of honorable position;</AYA>
		<AYA id="026059">Thus it was, but We made the Children of Israel inheritors of such things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="026060">So they pursued them at sunrise.</AYA>
		<AYA id="026061">And when the two bodies saw each other, the people of Moses said: "We are sure to be overtaken."</AYA>
		<AYA id="026062">(Moses) said: "By no means! My Lord is with me! Soon will He guide me!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="026063">Then We told Moses by inspiration: "Strike the sea with thy rod." So it divided, and each separate part became like the huge, firm mass of a mountain.</AYA>
		<AYA id="026064">And We made the other party approach thither.</AYA>
		<AYA id="026065">We delivered Moses and all who were with him;</AYA>

		<AYA id="026175">And verily thy Lord is He, the Exalted in Might Most Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="026176">The Companions of the Wood rejected the messengers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="026177">Behold, Shuib said to them: "Will ye not fear (Allah)?</AYA>
		<AYA id="026178">"I am to you a messenger worthy of all trust.</AYA>
		<AYA id="026179">"So fear Allah and obey me.</AYA>
		<AYA id="026180">"No reward do I ask of you for it: my reward is only from the Lord of the Worlds.</AYA>
		<AYA id="026181">"Give just measure, and cause no loss (to others by fraud).</AYA>
		<AYA id="026182">"And weigh with scales true and upright.</AYA>
		<AYA id="026183">"And withhold not things justly due to men, nor do evil in the land, working mischief.</AYA>
		<AYA id="026184">"And fear Him Who created you and (Who created) the generations before (you)"</AYA>
		<AYA id="026185">They said: "Thou art only one of those bewitched!</AYA>
		<AYA id="026186">"Thou art no more than a mortal like us, and indeed we think thou art a liar!</AYA>
		<AYA id="026187">"Now cause a piece of the sky to fall on us, if thou art truthful!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="026188">He said: "My Lord knows best what ye do."</AYA>
		<AYA id="026189">But they rejected him. Then the punishment of a day of overshadowing gloom seized them, and that was the Chastisement of a Great Day.</AYA>
		<AYA id="026190">Verily in that is a Sign: but most of them do not believe.</AYA>
		<AYA id="026191">And verily thy Lord is He, the Exalted in Might, Most Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="026192">Verily this is a Revelation from the Lord of the Worlds:</AYA>
		<AYA id="026193">With it came down the Truthful Spirit-</AYA>
		<AYA id="026194">To thy heart, that thou mayest admonish.</AYA>
		<AYA id="026195">In the perspicuous Arabic tongue.</AYA>
		<AYA id="026196">Without doubt it is (announced) in the revealed Books of former peoples.</AYA>
		<AYA id="026197">Is it not a Sign to them that the Learned of the Children of Israel knew it (as true)?</AYA>
		<AYA id="026198">Had We revealed it to any of the non-Arabs,</AYA>
		<AYA id="026199">And had he recited it to them, they would not have believed in it.</AYA>
		<AYA id="026200">Thus have We caused it to enter the hearts of t b02 he sinners.</AYA>
		<AYA id="026201">They will not believe in it until they see the grievous Chastisement;</AYA>
		<AYA id="026202">But it will come to them of a sudden, while they perceive it not;</AYA>
		<AYA id="026203">Then they will say: "Shall we be respited?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="026204">Do they then ask for Our Chastisement to be hastened on?</AYA>
		<AYA id="026205">Seest thou? If We do let them enjoy (this life) for a few years,</AYA>
		<AYA id="026206">Yet there comes to them at length the (punishment) which they were promised!</AYA>
		<AYA id="026207">It will profit them not the enjoyment they were given-</AYA>
		<AYA id="026208">Never did We destroy a town, but had its Warners -</AYA>
		<AYA id="026209">By way of reminder; and We never are unjust.</AYA>
		<AYA id="026210">The Satans did not bring it down:</AYA>
		<AYA id="026211">It is not meet for then, nor is it in their power,</AYA>
		<AYA id="026212">Indeed they are banished from hearing it.</AYA>
		<AYA id="026213">So call not on any other god with Allah, or thou wilt be among those who will be punished.</AYA>

		<AYA id="027001">These are verses of the Qur&#30115;,-a book that makes (things) clear;</AYA>
		<AYA id="027002">A Guide: and Glad Tidings for the believers,-</AYA>
		<AYA id="027003">Those who establish regular prayers and give Zakat, and also have sure faith in the hereafter.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027004">As to those who believe not in the Hereafter, We have made their deeds pleasing in their eyes; and so they wander about blindly.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027005">Such are they for whom a grievous Chastisement is (waiting); and in the Hereafter theirs will be the greatest loss.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027006">As to thee, thou receivest the Qur&#30115; from One All-Wise, All-Knowing.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027007">Behold! Moses said to his family: "I perceive a fire; soon will I bring you from there some information, or I will bring you a burning brand (to light our fuel), that ye may warn yourselves.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027008">But when he came to the (fire), a voice was heard: "Blessed are those in the fire and those around: and Glory to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027009">"O Moses! Verily, I am Allah, the Exalted in Might, the Wise! ...</AYA>
		<AYA id="027010">"Now do thou throw thy rod!" But when he saw it moving (of its own accord) as if it had been a snake, he turned back in retreat, and retraced not his steps: "O Moses!" (it was said), "Fear not: truly, in My presence, those called as messengers have no fear,-</AYA>
		<AYA id="027011">"But if any have done wrong and have thereafter substituted good to take the place of evil, truly, I am Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027012">"Now put thy hand into thy bosom, and it will come forth white without stain (or harm): (these are) among the nine Signs (thou wilt take) to Pharaoh and his people: for they are a people rebellious in transgression."</AYA>
		<AYA id="027013">But when Our Signs came to them, visibly, they said: "This is sorcery manifest!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="027014">And they denied them, though their souls acknowledge them wrongfully and out of pride: so see what was the end of those who acted corruptly!</AYA>
		<AYA id="027015">We gave knowledge to David and Solomon: And they both said: "Praise be to Allah, Who has favored us above many of His servants who believe!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="027016">And Solomon was David's heir. He said: "O ye people! We have been taught the speech of birds, and we have been given of every thing: this is indeed Grace manifest (from Allah.)"</AYA>
		<AYA id="027017">And before Solomon were marshaled his hosts,- of Jinns and men and birds, and they were all kept in order and ranks.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027018">At length, when they came to a valley of ants, one of the ants said: "O ye ants, get into your habitations, lest Solomon and his hosts crush you (under foot) without knowing it."</AYA>
		<AYA id="027019">So he smiled, amused at her speech; and he said: "O my Lord! So order me that I may be grateful for Thy favors, which Thou hast bestowed on me and on my parents, and that I may work the righteousness that will please Thee: and admit me, by Thy Grace, to the ranks of Thy Righteous Servants."</AYA>
		<AYA id="027020">And he took a muster of the Birds; and he said: "Why is it I see not the Hoopoe? Or is he among the absentees?</AYA>
		<AYA id="027021">"I will certainly punish him with a severe punishment, or execute him, unless he bring me a clear reason (for absence)."</AYA>
		<AYA id="027022">But the Hoopoe tarried not far: he (came up and) said: "I have compassed which thou hast not compassed, and I have come to thee from Sab&#12539;with tidings true.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027023">"I found (there) a woman ruling over them and provided with every requisite; and she has a magnificent throne.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027024">"I found her and her people worshipping the sun besides Allah. Satan has made their deeds seem pleasing in their eyes, and has kept them away from the Path,- so they receive no guidance,-</AYA>
		<AYA id="027025">"So that they worship not Allah, Who brings forth what is hidden in the heavens and the earth, and knows what ye hide and what ye reveal.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027026">"Allah!- there is no god but He!- Lord of the Throne Supreme!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="027027">(Solomon) said: "Soon shall we see whether thou hast told the truth or lied!</AYA>
		<AYA id="027028">"Go thou, with this letter of mine, and deliver it to them: then draw back from them, and (wait to) see what answer they return"...</AYA>
		<AYA id="027029">(The Queen) said: "Ye chiefs! here is delivered to me - a letter worthy of respect.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027030">"It is from Solomon, and is (as follows): 'In the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful:</AYA>
		<AYA id="027031">" 'Be ye not arrogant against me, but come to me in submission (to the true Religion).' "</AYA>
		<AYA id="027032">She said: "Ye chiefs! advise me in (this) my affair: no affair have I decided except in your presence."</AYA>
		<AYA id="027033">They said: "We are endued with strength, and given to vehement war: but the command is with thee; so consider what thou wilt command."</AYA>
		<AYA id="027034">She said: "Kings, when they enter a country, despoil it, and make the noblest of its people its meanest thus do they behave.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027035">"But I am going to send him a present, and (wait) to see with what (answer) return (my) ambassadors."</AYA>
		<AYA id="027036">Now when (the embassy) came to Solomon, he said: "Will ye give me abundance in wealth? But that which Allah has given me is better than that which He has given you! Nay it is ye who rejoice in your gift!</AYA>
		<AYA id="027037">"Go back to them, and be sure we shall come to them with such hosts as they will never be able to meet: We shall expel them from there in disgrace, and they will feel humbled (indeed)."</AYA>
		<AYA id="027038">He said (to his own men): "Ye chiefs! which of you can bring me her throne before they come to me in submission?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="027039">A stalwart of the Jinns said: "I will bring it to thee before thou rise from thy council: indeed I have full strength for the purpose, and may be trusted."</AYA>
		<AYA id="027040">Said one who had knowledge of the Book: "I will bring it to thee before ever thy glance returns to thee!" Then when (Solomon) saw it placed firmly before him, he said: "This is by the Grace of my Lord!- to test me whether I am grateful or ungrateful! and if any is grateful, truly his gratitude is (a gain) for his own soul; but if any is ungrateful, truly my Lord is Free of all Needs, Supreme in Honor !"</AYA>
		<AYA id="027041">He said: "Disguise her throne. Let us see whether she is guided (to the truth) or is one of those who are not rightly guided."</AYA>
		<AYA id="027042">So when she arrived, she was asked, "Is this thy throne?" She said, "It seems the same"; and knowledge was bestowed on us in advance of this, and we have submitted to Allah (in Isl&#30117;).</AYA>
		<AYA id="027043">And he diverted her from the worship of others besides Allah: for she was (sprung) of a people that had no faith.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027044">She was asked to enter the lofty Palace: but when she saw it, she thought it was a lake of water, and she (tucked up her skirts), uncovering her legs. He said: "This is but a palace paved smooth with slabs of glass." She said: "O my Lord! I have indeed wronged my soul: I do (now) submit (in Isl&#30117;), with Solomon, to the Lord of the Worlds."</AYA>
		<AYA id="027045">We sent (aforetime), to the Tham&#12539;, their brother S&#30109;ih, saying, "Serve Allah.: but behold, they became two factions quarreling with each other.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027046">He said: "O my people! why ask ye to hasten on the evil before the good? If only ye ask Allah for forgiveness, ye may hope to receive mercy."</AYA>
		<AYA id="027047">They said: "Ill omen do we augur from thee and those that are with thee". He said: "Your ill omen is with Allah. yea, ye are a people under trial."</AYA>
		<AYA id="027048">There were in the city nine men, who made mischief in the land, and would not reform.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027049">They said: "Swear a mutual oath by Allah that we shall make a secret night attack on him and his people, and that we shall then say to his heir (when he seeks vengeance): 'We were not present at the slaughter of his people, and we are positively telling the truth.'"</AYA>
		<AYA id="027050">They plotted and planned, but We too planned, even while they perceived it not.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027051">Then see what was the end of their plot!- this, that We destroyed them and their people, all (of them).</AYA>
		<AYA id="027052">Now such were their houses, - in utter ruin, - because they practiced wrong- doing. Verily in this is a Sign for people of knowledge.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027053">And We saved those who believed and practiced righteousness.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027054">(We also sent) L&#12539; (as a messenger): behold, he said to his people, "Do ye do what is indecent though ye see (its iniquity)?</AYA>
		<AYA id="027055">"Would ye really approach men in your lusts rather than women? Nay, ye are a people (grossly) ignorant!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="027056">But his people gave no other answer but this: they said, "Drive out the followers of L&#12539; from your city: these are indeed men who want to be clean and pure!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="027057">But We saved him and his family, except his wife; her We destined to be of those who lagged behind.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027058">And We rained down on them a shower (of brimstone): and evil was the shower on those who were admonished (but heeded not)!</AYA>
		<AYA id="027059">Say: Praise be to Allah, and Peace on His servants whom He has chosen (for His Message). (Who) is better?- Allah or the false gods they associate (with Him)?</AYA>
		<AYA id="027060">Or, Who has created the heavens and the earth, and Who sends you down rain from the sky? Yea, with it We cause to grow well-planted orchards full of beauty of delight: it is not in your power to cause the growth of the trees in them. (Can there be another) god besides Allah? Nay, they are a people who swerve from justice.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027061">Or, Who has made the earth firm to live in; made rivers in its midst; set thereon mountains immovable; and made a separating bar between the two seas? (Can there be another) god besides Allah? Nay, most of them know not.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027062">Or, Who listens to the distressed when he calls on Him, and Who relieves his suffering, and makes you (mankind) inheritors of the earth? (Can there be another) god besides Allah? Little it is that ye heed!</AYA>
		<AYA id="027063">Or, Who guides you through the depths of darkness on land and sea, and Who sends the winds as heralds of glad tidings, going before His Mercy? (Can there be another) god besides Allah?- High is Allah above what they associate with Him!</AYA>
		<AYA id="027064">Or, Who originates Creation, then repeats it, and who gives you sustenance from heaven and earth? (Can there be another) god besides Allah? Say, "Bring forth your argument, if ye are telling the truth!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="027065">Say: None in the heavens or on earth, except Allah, knows what is hidden: nor can they perceive when they shall be raised up (for Judgment).</AYA>
		<AYA id="027066">Nay, but their knowledge fails as to the Hereafter: they are in doubt and uncertainty thereanent; nay, they are blind thereunto!</AYA>
		<AYA id="027067">The Unbelievers say: "What! When we become dust,- we and our fathers,- shall we really be raised (from the dead)?</AYA>
		<AYA id="027068">"It is true we were promised this,- we and our fathers before (us): these are nothing but tales of the ancients."</AYA>
		<AYA id="027069">Say: "Go ye through the earth and see what has been the end of those guilty (of sin)."</AYA>
		<AYA id="027070">But grieve not over them, nor distress thyself because of their plots.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027071">They also say: "When will this promise (come to pass)? If ye are truthful."</AYA>
		<AYA id="027072">Say: "It may be that some of the events which ye wish to hasten on may be (close) in your pursuit!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="027073">But verily thy Lord is full of grace to mankind: Yet most of them are ungrateful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027074">And verily thy Lord knoweth all that their hearts do hide. As well as all that they reveal.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027075">And there is nothing hidden, in heaven or earth, but is (recorded) in a clear record.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027076">Verily this Qur&#30115; doth explain to the Children of Israel most of the matters in which they disagree.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027077">And it certainly is a Guide and a Mercy to those who believe.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027078">Verily thy Lord will decide between them by His Decree: and He is Exalted in Might, All-Knowing.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027079">So put thy trust in Allah: for thou art on (the path of) manifest Truth.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027080">Truly thou canst not cause the dead to listen, nor canst thou cause the deaf to hear the call, (especially) when they turn back in retreat.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027081">Nor canst thou be a guide to the blind, (to prevent them) from straying: only those wilt thou get to listen who believe in Our Signs, so they submit.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027082">And when the Word is fulfilled against them (the unjust), we shall bring forth from the earth a Beast to speak unto them because mankind had no faith in Our Signs.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027083">The Day We shall gather together from every people a troop of those who reject Our Signs, and they shall be kept in ranks,-</AYA>
		<AYA id="027084">Until, when they come (before the Judgment-seat), (Allah) will say: "Did ye reject My Signs, though ye comprehended them not in knowledge, or what was it ye did?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="027085">And the Word will be fulfilled against them, because of their wrong-doing, and they will be unable to speak (in plea).</AYA>
		<AYA id="027086">See they not that We have made the Night for them to rest in and the Day to give them light? Verily in this are Signs for any people that believe!</AYA>
		<AYA id="027087">And the Day that the Trumpet will be sounded - then will be smitten with terror those who are in the heavens, and those who are on earth, except such as Allah will please (to exempt): and all shall come to Him in utter humility.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027088">Thou seest the mountains and thinkest them firmly fixed: but they shall pass away as the clouds pass away: (such is) the artistry of Allah, who disposes of all things in perfect order: for He is well acquainted with all that ye do.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027089">If any do good, he will have better than it; and they will be secure from terror that Day.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027090">And if any do evil, their faces will be thrown headlong into the Fire: "Do ye receive a reward other than that which ye have earned by your deeds?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="027091">For me, I have been commanded to serve the Lord of this City, Him Who has sanctified it and to Whom (belong) all things: and I am commanded to be of those who bow in Isl&#30117; to Allah's Will,-</AYA>
		<AYA id="027092">And to rehearse the Qur&#30115;: and if any accept guidance, they do it for the good of their own souls, and if any stray, say: "I am only a Warner".</AYA>
		<AYA id="027093">And say: "Praise be to Allah, Who will soon show you His Signs, so that ye shall know them"; and thy Lord is not unmindful of all that ye do.</AYA>

	<SOURA id="28" name="The Narrative">
		<AYA id="028001">T. Sn. Mm.</AYA>
		<AYA id="028002">These are Verses of the Book that makes (things) clear.</AYA>
		<AYA id="028003">We rehearse to thee some of the story of Moses and Pharaoh in Truth, for people who believe.</AYA>
		<AYA id="028004">Truly Pharaoh elated himself in the land and divided its people into sections, depressing a group among them: their sons he slew, but he kept alive their females: for he was indeed an evil- doer.</AYA>
		<AYA id="028005">And We wished to be Gracious to those who were being depressed in the land, to make them leaders (in faith) and make them heirs,</AYA>
		<AYA id="028006">To establish a firm place for them in the land, and to show Pharaoh, Hmn and their hosts, what they were dreading from them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="028007">So We sent this inspiration to the mother of Moses: "Suckle (thy child), but when thou hast fears about him, cast him into the river, but fear not nor grieve: for We shall restore him to thee, and We shall make him one of Our messengers."</AYA>
		<AYA id="028008">Then the people of Pharaoh picked him up (from the river): (It was intended) that (Moses) should be to them an adversary and a cause of sorrow: for Pharaoh and Hmn and (all) their hosts were men of sin.</AYA>
		<AYA id="028009">The wife of Pharaoh said: "(Here is) joy of the eye, for me and for thee: slay him not. It may be that he will be use to us, or we may adopt him as a son." And they perceived not (what they were doing)!</AYA>
		<AYA id="028010">And the heart of the mother of Moses became void: she was going almost to disclose his (case), had We not strengthened her heart (with faith), so that she might remain a (firm) believer.</AYA>
		<AYA id="028011">And she said to the sister of (Moses), "Trace him" So she (the sister) watched him from a distance and they perceived not.</AYA>
		<AYA id="028012">And We ordained that he refused suck at first, until (his sister came up and) said: "Shall I point out to you the people of a house that will nourish and bring him up for you and take care of him?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="028013">Thus did We restore him to his mother, that her eye might be comforted, that she might not grieve, and that she might know that the promise of Allah is true: but most of them do not know.</AYA>
		<AYA id="028014">When he reached full age, and was firmly established (in life), We bestowed on him wisdom and knowledge: for thus do We reward those who do good.</AYA>
		<AYA id="028015">And he entered the City at a time when its people were not watching: and he found there two men fighting,- one of his own people, and the other, of his foes. Now the man of his own people appealed to him against his foe, and Moses struck him with his fist and killed him. He said: "This is a work of Satan: for he is an enemy that manifestly misleads!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="028016">He prayed: "O my Lord! I have indeed wronged my soul! Do Thou then forgive me!" So (Allah) forgave him: for He is the Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="028017">He said: "O my Lord! For that Thou hast bestowed Thy Grace on me, never shall I be a help to those who sin!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="028018">In the morning he was in the city, fearful and vigilant, when behold, the man who had, the day before, sought his help called aloud for his help (again). Moses said to him: "Thou art truly, one erring manifestly!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="028019">Then, when he was about to lay his hand on their enemy, the man said: "O Moses! Is it thy intention to slay me as thou slewest a man yesterday? Thou only desire to become a tyrant in the land, and not to be one who sets things right!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="028020">And there came a man, running, from the furthest end of the City. He said: "O Moses! the Chiefs are taking counsel together about thee, to slay thee: so get thee away, for I do give thee sincere advice."</AYA>
		<AYA id="028021">He therefore got away therefrom, looking about, in a state of fear. He prayed "O my Lord! save me from people given to wrong-doing."</AYA>
		<AYA id="028022">Then, when he turned his face towards (the land of) Madyan, he said: "I do hope that my Lord will show me the smooth and straight Path."</AYA>
		<AYA id="028023">And when he arrived at the watering (place) in Madyan, he found there a group of men watering (their flocks), and besides them he found two women who were keeping back (their flocks). He said: "What is the matter with you?" They said: "We cannot water (our flocks) until the shepherds take back (their flocks): and our father is a very old man."</AYA>
		<AYA id="028024">So he watered (their flocks) for them; then he turned back to the shade, and said: "O my Lord! truly am I in (desperate) need of any good that Thou dost send me!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="028025">Afterwards one of the (damsels) came (back) to him, walking bashfully. She said: "My father invites thee that he may reward thee for having watered (our flocks) for us." So when he came to him and narrated the story, he said: "Fear thou not: (well) hast thou escaped from unjust people."</AYA>
		<AYA id="028026">Said one of the (damsels): "O my (dear) father! engage him on wages: truly the best of men for thee to employ is the (man) who is strong and trusty"....</AYA>
		<AYA id="028027">He said: "I intend to wed one of these my daughters to thee, on condition that thou serve me for eight years; but if thou complete ten years, it will be (grace) from thee. But I intend not to place thee under a difficulty: thou wilt find me, indeed, if Allah wills, one of the righteous."</AYA>
		<AYA id="028028">He said: "Be that (the agreement) between me and thee: whichever of the two terms I fulfill, let there be no injustice to me. Be Allah a witness to what we say."</AYA>
		<AYA id="028029">Now when Moses had fulfilled the term, and was traveling with his family, he perceived a fire in the direction of Mount Tr. He said to his family: "Tarry ye; I perceive a fire; I hope to bring you from there some information, or a burning firebrand, that ye may warm yourselves."</AYA>
		<AYA id="028030">But when he came to the (fire), he was called from the right bank of the valley, from a tree in hallowed ground: "O Moses! Verily I am Allah, the Lord of the Worlds....</AYA>
		<AYA id="028031">"Now do thou throw thy rod!" But when he saw it moving (of its own accord) as if it had been a snake, he turned back in retreat, and retraced not his steps: "O Moses!" (It was said), "Draw near, and fear not: for thou art of those who are secure.</AYA>
		<AYA id="028032">"Thrust thy hand into thy bosom, and it will come forth white without stain (or harm), and draw thy hand close to thy side (to guard) against fear. Those are the two credentials from thy Lord to Pharaoh and his Chiefs: for truly they are a people rebellious and wicked."</AYA>
		<AYA id="028033">He said: "O my Lord! I have slain a man among them, and I fear lest they slay me.</AYA>
		<AYA id="028034">"And my brother Aaron - He is more eloquent in speech than I: so send him with me as a helper, to confirm (and strengthen) me: for I fear that they may accuse me of falsehood."</AYA>
		<AYA id="028035">He said: "We will certainly strengthen thy arm through thy brother, and invest you both with authority, so they shall not be able to touch you: with Our Sign shall ye triumph,- you two as well as those who follow you."</AYA>
		<AYA id="028036">When Moses came to them with Our Clear Signs, they said: "This is nothing but sorcery faked up : never did we hear the like among our fathers of old!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="028037">Moses said: "My Lord knows best who it is that comes with guidance from Him and whose end will be best in the Hereafter: certain it is that the wrong-doers will not prosper."</AYA>
		<AYA id="028038">Pharaoh said: "O Chiefs! No god do I know for you but myself: therefore, O Hmn! light me a (kiln to bake bricks) out of clay, and build me a lofty palace, that I may mount up to the god of Moses: but as far as I am concerned, I think (Moses) is a liar!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="028039">And he was arrogant and insolent in the land, beyond reason,- he and his hosts: they thought that they would not have to return to Us!</AYA>
		<AYA id="028040">So We seized him and his hosts, and We flung them into the sea. Now behold what was the end of those who did wrong!</AYA>
		<AYA id="028041">And we made them (but) leaders inviting to the Fire; and on the Day of Judgment no help shall they find.</AYA>
		<AYA id="028042">In this world We made a curse to follow them and on the Day of Judgment they will be among the loathed (and despised).</AYA>
		<AYA id="028043">We did reveal to Moses the Book after We had destroyed the earlier generations, (to give) Insight to men, and Guidance and Mercy, that they might receive admonition.</AYA>
		<AYA id="028044">Thou wast not on the Western side when We decreed the Commission to Moses, nor wast thou a witness (of those events).</AYA>
		<AYA id="028045">But We raised up (new) generations, and long were the ages that passed over them; but thou wast not a dweller among the people of Madyan, rehearsing Our Signs to them; but it is We Who send apostles (with inspiration).</AYA>
		<AYA id="028046">Nor wast thou at the side of (the Mountain of) Tr when We called (to Moses). Yet (art thou sent) as Mercy from thy Lord, to give warning to a people to whom no warner had come before thee: in order that they may receive admonition.</AYA>
		<AYA id="028047">If (We had) not (sent thee to the Quraish),- in case a calamity should seize them for (the deeds) that their hands have sent forth, they might say: "Our Lord! why didst Thou not sent us an messenger? We should then have followed Thy Signs and been amongst those who believe!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="028048">But (now), when the Truth has come to them from Ourselves, they say, "Why are not (Signs) sent to him, like those which were sent to Moses?" Do they not then reject (the Signs) which were formerly sent to Moses? They say: "Two kinds of sorcery, each assisting the other!" And they say: "For us, we reject all (such things)!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="028049">Say: "Then bring ye a Book from Allah, which is a better guide than either of them, that I may follow it! (Do), if ye are truthful!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="028050">But if they hearken not to thee, know that they only follow their own lusts: and who is more astray than one who follow his own lusts, devoid of guidance from Allah? For Allah guides not people given to wrong-doing.</AYA>
		<AYA id="028051">Now have We brought them the, in order that they may receive admonition.</AYA>
		<AYA id="028052">Those to whom We sent the Book before this,- they do believe in this (revelation):</AYA>
		<AYA id="028053">And when it is recited to them, they say: "We believe therein, for it is the Truth from our Lord: indeed we have been Muslims (bowing to Allah's Will) from before this.</AYA>
		<AYA id="028054">Twice will they be given their reward, for that they have persevered, that they avert Evil with Good, and that they spend (in charity) out of what We have given them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="028055">And when they hear vain talk, they turn away therefrom and say: "To us our deeds, and to you yours; peace be to you: we seek not the ignorant."</AYA>
		<AYA id="028056">It is true thou wilt not be able to guide every one whom thou lovest; but Allah guides those whom He will and He knows best those who receive guidance.</AYA>
		<AYA id="028057">They say: "If we were to follow the guidance with thee, we should be snatched away from our land." Have We not established for them a secure sanctuary, to which are brought as tribute fruits of all kinds,- a provision from Ourselves? But most of them understand not.</AYA>
		<AYA id="028058">And how many towns We destroyed, which exulted in their life (of ease and plenty)! Now those habitations of theirs, after them, are deserted,- all but a (miserable) few! and We are their heirs!</AYA>
		<AYA id="028059">Nor was thy Lord the one to destroy a town until He had sent to its center a messengers, rehearsing to them Our Signs; nor are We going to destroy a population except when its members practice iniquity.</AYA>
		<AYA id="028060">The (material) things which ye are given are but the conveniences of this life and the glitter thereof; but that which is with Allah is better and more enduring: will ye not then be wise?</AYA>
		<AYA id="028061">Are (these two) alike?- one to whom We have made a goodly promise, and who is going to reach its (fulfillment), and one to whom We have given the good things of this life, but who, on the Day of Judgment, is to be among those brought up (for punishment)?</AYA>
		<AYA id="028062">That Day (Allah) will call to them, and say "Where are My 'partners'?- whom ye imagined (to be such)?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="028063">Those against whom the charge will be proved, will say: "Our Lord! These are the ones whom we led astray: we led them astray, as we were astray ourselves: we free ourselves (from them) to You. It was not us they worshipped."</AYA>
		<AYA id="028064">It will be said (to them): "Call upon your 'partners' (for help)" :they will call upon them, but they will not listen to them; and they will see the Chastisement (before them); (how they will wish) 'If only they had been open to guidance!'</AYA>
		<AYA id="028065">That Day (Allah) will call to them, and say: "What was the answer ye gave to the messengers?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="028066">Then the argument will be obscure to them and they will not be able (even) to question each other.</AYA>
		<AYA id="028067">But any that (in this life) had repented, believed, and worked righteousness, haply he shall be one of the successful..</AYA>
		<AYA id="028068">Thy Lord does create and choose as He pleases: no choice have they (in the matter): Glory to Allah! and far is He above the partners they ascribe (to Him)!</AYA>
		<AYA id="028069">And thy Lord knows all that their hearts conceal and all that they reveal.</AYA>
		<AYA id="028070">And He is Allah: there is no god but He. To Him be praise, at the first and at the last: for Him is the Command, and to Him shall ye (all) be brought back.</AYA>
		<AYA id="028071">Say: See ye? If Allah were to make the night perpetual over you to the Day of Judgment, what god is there other than Allah, who can give you light? Will ye not then hearken?</AYA>
		<AYA id="028072">Say: See ye? If Allah were to make the day perpetual over you to the Day of Judgment, what god is there other than Allah, who can give you a night in which ye can rest? Will ye not then see?</AYA>
		<AYA id="028073">It is out of His Mercy that He has made for you Night and Day,- that ye may rest therein, and that ye may seek of His Grace;- and in order that ye may be grateful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="028074">The Day that He will call on them, He will say: "Where are My 'partners'? whom ye imagined (to be such)?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="028075">And from each people shall We draw a witness, and We shall say: "Produce your Proof": then shall they know that the Truth is with Allah (alone), and the (lies) which they invented will leave them in lurch.</AYA>
		<AYA id="028076">Qrn was doubtless, of the people of Moses; but he acted insolently towards them: such were the treasures We had d36 bestowed on him that their very keys would have been a burden to a body of strong men, behold, his people said to him: "Exult not, for Allah loveth not those who exult (in riches).</AYA>
		<AYA id="028077">"But seek, with the (wealth) which Allah has bestowed on thee, the Home of the Hereafter, nor forget thy portion in this world: but do thou good, as Allah has been good to thee, and seek not (occasions for) mischief in the land: for Allah loves not those who do mischief."</AYA>
		<AYA id="028078">He said: "This has been given to me because of a certain knowledge which I have." Did he not know that Allah had destroyed, before him, (whole) generations,- which were superior to him in strength and greater in the amount (of riches) they had collected? But the wicked are not called (immediately) to account for their sins.</AYA>
		<AYA id="028079">So he went forth among his people in the (pride of his worldly) glitter. Said those whose aim is the life of this world: "Oh! that we had the like of what Qrn has got! for he is truly a lord of mighty good fortune!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="028080">But those who had been granted (true) knowledge said: "Alas for you! The reward of Allah (in the Hereafter) is best for those who believe and work righteousness: but this none shall attain, save those who steadfastly persevere (in good)."</AYA>
		<AYA id="028081">Then We caused the earth to swallow up him and his house; and he had not (the least little) party to help him against Allah, nor could he defend himself.</AYA>
		<AYA id="028082">And those who had envied his position the day before began to say on the morrow: "Ah! It is indeed Allah Who enlarges the provision or restricts it, to any of His servants He pleases! Had it not been that Allah was gracious to us, He could have caused the earth to swallow us up! Ah! Those who reject Allah will assuredly never prosper."</AYA>
		<AYA id="028083">That Home of the Hereafter We shall give to those who intend not high- handedness or mischief on earth: and the end is (best) for the righteous.</AYA>
		<AYA id="028084">If any does good, the reward to him is better than his deed; but if any does evil, the doers of evil are only punished (to the extent) of their deeds.</AYA>
		<AYA id="028085">Verily He Who ordained the Quran for thee, will bring thee back to the Place of Return. Say: "My Lord knows best who it is that brings true guidance, and who is in manifest error."</AYA>
		<AYA id="028086">And thou hadst not expected that the Book would be sent to thee except as a Mercy from thy Lord: Therefore lend not thou support in any way to those who reject (Allah's Message).</AYA>
		<AYA id="028087">Let no one turn you away from Allah's revelations after they have been revealed to thee: and invite (men) to thy Lord, and be not of the company of those who join gods with Allah.</AYA>
		<AYA id="028088">And call not, besides Allah, on another god. There is no god but He. Everything (that exists) will perish except His Face. To Him belongs the Command, and to Him will ye (all) be brought back.</AYA>

		<AYA id="029002">Do men think that they will be left alone on saying, "We believe", and that they will not be tested?</AYA>
		<AYA id="029003">We did test those before them, and Allah will certainly know those who are true from those who are false.</AYA>
		<AYA id="029004">Do those who practice evil think that they will outstrip Us? Evil is their judgment!</AYA>
		<AYA id="029005">For those whose hopes are in the meeting with Allah, the Term (appointed) by Allah is surely coming: and He hears and knows (all things).</AYA>
		<AYA id="029006">And if any strive (with might and main), they do so for their own souls: for Allah is free of all needs from all creation.</AYA>
		<AYA id="029007">Those who believe and work righteous deeds,- from them shall We blot out all misdeed that they have committed, and We shall reward them according to the best of their deeds.</AYA>
		<AYA id="029008">We have enjoined on man kindness to parents: but if they (either of them) strive (to force) thee to join with Me (in worship) anything of which thou hast no knowledge, obey them not. Ye have (all) to return to Me, and I will tell you (the truth) of all that ye did.</AYA>
		<AYA id="029009">And those who believe and work righteous deeds,- them shall We admit to the company of the Righteous.</AYA>
		<AYA id="029010">Then there are among men such as say, "We believe in Allah"; but when they suffer affliction in (the Cause of) Allah, they treat men's oppression as if it were the Wrath of Allah. And if help comes (to thee) from thy Lord, they are sure to say, "We have (always) been with you!" Does not Allah know best all that is in the hearts of all creation?</AYA>
		<AYA id="029011">And Allah most certainly knows those who believe, and as certainly those who are Hypocrites.</AYA>
		<AYA id="029012">And the Unbelievers say to those who believe: "Follow our path, and we will bear (the consequences) of your faults." Never in the least will they bear their faults: in fact they are liars!</AYA>
		<AYA id="029013">They will bear their own burdens, and (other) burdens along with their own, and on the Day of Judgments they will be called to account for their falsehoods.</AYA>
		<AYA id="029014">We did send Noah to his people, and he tarried among them a thousand years less fifty: but the Deluge overwhelmed them while they (persisted in) sin.</AYA>
		<AYA id="029015">But We saved him and the companions of the Ark, and We made the (Ark) a Sign for all peoples!</AYA>
		<AYA id="029016">And (We also saved) Abraham: behold, he said to his people, "Serve Allah and fear Him: that will be best for you- If ye understand!</AYA>
		<AYA id="029017">"For ye do worship idols besides Allah, and ye invent falsehood. The things that ye worship besides Allah have no power to give you sustenance: then seek ye sustenance from Allah, serve Him, and be grateful to Him: to Him will be your return.</AYA>
		<AYA id="029018">"And if ye reject (the Message), so did generations before you: and the duty of the messenger is only to preach publicly (and clearly)."</AYA>
		<AYA id="029019">See they not how Allah originates creation, then repeats it: truly that is easy for Allah.</AYA>
		<AYA id="029020">Say: "Travel through the earth and see how Allah did originate creation; so will Allah produce a later creation: for Allah has power over all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="029021">"He punishes whom He pleases, and He grants Mercy to whom He pleases, and towards Him are ye turned.</AYA>
		<AYA id="029022">"Not on earth nor in heaven will ye be able (fleeing) to frustrate (His Plan), nor have ye, besides Allah, any protector or helper."</AYA>
		<AYA id="029023">Those who reject the Signs of Allah and the Meeting with Him (in the Hereafter),- it is they who shall despair of My Mercy: it is they who will (suffer) a most grievous Chastisement.</AYA>
		<AYA id="029024">So naught was the answer of (Abraham's) people except that they said: "Slay him or burn him." But Allah did save him from the Fire. Verily in this are Signs for people who believe.</AYA>
		<AYA id="029025">And he said: "For you, ye have taken (for worship) idols besides Allah, out of mutual love and regard between yourselves in this life; but on the Day of Judgment ye shall disown each other and curse each other: and your abode will be the Fire, and ye shall have none to help."</AYA>
		<AYA id="029026">But Lt believed him. He said: "I will leave home for the sake of my Lord: for He is Exalted in Might, and Wise."</AYA>
		<AYA id="029027">And We gave (Abraham) Isaac and Jacob, and ordained among his progeny Prophethood and Revelation, and We granted him his reward in this life; and he will be in the Hereafter of the Righteous.</AYA>
		<AYA id="029028">And (remember) Lt: behold, he said to his people: "Ye do commit lewdness, such as no people in Creation (ever) committed before you.</AYA>
		<AYA id="029029">"Do ye indeed approach men, and cut off the highway?- and practice wickedness (even) in your councils?" But his people gave no answer but this: they said: "Bring us the Wrath of Allah if thou tellest the truth."</AYA>
		<AYA id="029030">He said: "O my Lord! Help Thou me against people who do mischief!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="029031">When Our Messengers came to Abraham with the good news, they said: "We are indeed going to destroy the people of this township: for truly they are wicked men."</AYA>
		<AYA id="029032">He said: "But there is Lt there." They said: "We know well who is there : we will certainly save him and his following,- except his wife: she is of those who lag behind!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="029033">And when Our Messengers came to Lt, he was grieved on their account, and felt himself powerless (to protect) them: but they said: "Fear thou not, nor grieve: we are (here) to save thee and thy following, except thy wife: she is of those who lag behind.</AYA>
		<AYA id="029034">"For we are going to bring down on the people of this township a Punishment from heaven, because they have been wickedly rebellious."</AYA>
		<AYA id="029035">And We have left thereof an evident Sign, for any people who (care to) understand.</AYA>
		<AYA id="029036">To the Madyan (people) (We sent) their brother Shuib. Then he said: "O my people! Serve Allah, and fear the Last Day: nor commit evil on the earth, with intent to do mischief."</AYA>
		<AYA id="029037">But they rejected him: then the mighty Blast seized them, and they lay prostrate in their homes by the morning.</AYA>
		<AYA id="029038">(Remember also) the d and the Thamd (people): clearly will appear to you from (the traces) of their buildings (their fate): Satan made their deeds alluring to them, and kept them back from the Path, though they were keen-sighted.</AYA>
		<AYA id="029039">(Remember also) Qrn, Pharaoh, and Hmn: there came to them Moses with Clear Signs, but they behaved with insolence on the earth; yet they could not overreach (Us).</AYA>
		<AYA id="029040">Each one of them We seized for his crime: of them, against some We sent a violent tornado (with showers of stones); some were caught by a (mighty) Blast; some We caused the earth to swallow up; and some We drowned (in the waters): It was not Allah Who wronged them: they wronged themselves.</AYA>
		<AYA id="029041">The parable of those who take protectors other than Allah is that of the spider, who builds (to itself) a house; but truly the flimsiest of houses is the spider's house;- if they but knew.</AYA>
		<AYA id="029042">Verily Allah doth know of (every thing) whatever that they call upon besides Him: and He is Exalted (in power), Wise.</AYA>
		<AYA id="029043">And such are the Parables We set forth for mankind, but only those understand them who have knowledge.</AYA>
		<AYA id="029044">Allah created the heavens and the earth in truth: verily in that is a Sign for those who believe.</AYA>
		<AYA id="029045">Recite what is sent of the Book by inspiration to thee, and establish regular prayer: for prayer restrains from shameful and evil deeds; and remembrance of Allah is the greatest (thing in life) without doubt. And Allah knows the (deeds) that ye do.</AYA>
		<AYA id="029046">And dispute ye not with the People of the Book, except in the best way, unless it be with those of them who do wrong: but say, "We believe in the revelation which has come down to us and in that which came down to you. Our God and your God is One; and it is to Him we submit (in Islm)."</AYA>
		<AYA id="029047">And thus (it is) that We have sent down the Book to thee. So the People of the Book believe therein, as also do some of these (pagan Arabs): and none but Unbelievers reject Our Signs.</AYA>
		<AYA id="029048">And thou wast not (able) to recite a Book before this (Book came), nor art thou (able) to transcribe it with thy right hand: In that case, indeed, would the talkers of vanities have doubted.</AYA>
		<AYA id="029049">Nay, here are Signs self-evident in the hearts of those endowed with knowledge: and none but the unjust reject Our Signs.</AYA>
		<AYA id="029050">Ye they say: "Why are not Signs sent down to him from his Lord?" Say: "The signs are indeed with Allah: and I am indeed a clear Warner."</AYA>
		<AYA id="029051">And is it not enough for them that we have sent down to thee the Book which is rehearsed to them? Verily, in it is Mercy and a Reminder to those who believe.</AYA>
		<AYA id="029052">Say: "Enough is Allah for a witness between me and you: He knows what is in the heavens and on earth". And it is those who believe in vanities and reject Allah, that are the losers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="029053">They ask thee to hasten on the Punishment (for them): had it not been for a term (of respite) appointed, the Punishment would certainly have come to them: and it will certainly reach them,- of a sudden, while they perceive not!</AYA>
		<AYA id="029054">They ask thee to hasten on the Punishment: but, of a surety, Hell will encompass the rejecters of Faith!-</AYA>
		<AYA id="029055">On the Day that the Punishment shall cover them from above them and from below them, and (a Voice) shall say: "Taste ye (the fruits) of your deeds!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="029056">O My servants who believe! Truly, spacious is My Earth: therefore serve ye Me - (and Me alone)!</AYA>
		<AYA id="029057">Every soul shall have a taste of death: in the end to Us shall ye be brought back.</AYA>
		<AYA id="029058">But those who believe and work deeds of righteousness - to them shall We give a Home in Heaven,- lofty mansions beneath which flow rivers,- to dwell therein for aye;- an excellent reward for those who do (good)!-</AYA>
		<AYA id="029059">Those who persevere in patience, and put their trust, in their Lord and Cherisher.</AYA>
		<AYA id="029060">How many are the creatures that carry not their own sustenance? It is Allah who feeds (both) them and you: for He hears and knows (all things).</AYA>
		<AYA id="029061">If indeed thou ask them who has created the heavens and the earth and subjected the sun and the moon (to His Law), they will certainly reply, "Allah". How are they then deluded away (from the truth)?</AYA>
		<AYA id="029062">Allah enlarges the sustenance (which He gives) to whichever of His servants He pleases; and He (similarly) grants by (strict) measure, (as He pleases): for Allah h 663 as full knowledge of all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="029063">And if indeed thou ask them who it is that sends down rain from the sky, and gives life therewith to the earth after its death, they will certainly reply, "Allah!" Say, "Praise be to Allah!" But most of them understand not.</AYA>
		<AYA id="029064">What is the life of this world but amusement and play? But verily the Home in the Hereafter,- that is life indeed, if they but knew.</AYA>
		<AYA id="029065">Now, if they embark on a boat, they call on Allah, making their devotion sincerely (and exclusively) to Him; but when He has delivered them safely to (dry) land, behold, they give a share (of their worship to others)!-</AYA>
		<AYA id="029066">Disdaining ungratefully Our gifts, and giving themselves up to (worldly) enjoyment! But soon will they know.</AYA>
		<AYA id="029067">Do they not then see that We have made a Sanctuary secure, and that men are being snatched away from all around them? Then, do they believe in that which is vain, and reject the Grace of Allah?</AYA>
		<AYA id="029068">And who does more wrong than he who invents a lie against Allah or rejects the Truth when it reaches him? Is there not a home in Hell for those who reject Faith?</AYA>
		<AYA id="029069">And those who strive in Our (cause),- We will certainly guide them to Our Paths: For verily Allah is with those who do right.</AYA>

		<AYA id="030019">It is He Who brings out the living from the dead, and brings out the dead from the living, and Who gives life to the earth after it is dead: and thus shall ye be brought out (from the dead).</AYA>
		<AYA id="030020">Among His Signs in this, that He created you from dust; and then,- behold, ye are men scattered (far and wide)!</AYA>
		<AYA id="030021">And among His Signs is this, that He created for you mates from among yourselves, that ye may dwell in tranquillity with them, and He has put love and mercy between your (hearts): verily in that are Signs for those who reflect.</AYA>
		<AYA id="030022">And among His Signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the variations in your languages and your colors: verily in that are Signs for those who know.</AYA>
		<AYA id="030023">And among His Signs is the sleep that ye take by night and by day, and the quest that ye (make for livelihood) out of His Bounty: verily in that are Signs for those who hearken.</AYA>
		<AYA id="030024">And among His Signs, He shows you the lightning, by way both of fear and of hope, and He sends down rain from the sky and with it gives life to the earth after it is dead: verily in that are Signs for those who are wise.</AYA>
		<AYA id="030025">And among His Signs is this, that heaven and earth stand by His Command: then when He calls you, by a single call, from the earth, behold, ye (straightway) come forth.</AYA>
		<AYA id="030026">To Him belongs every being that is in the heavens and on earth: all are devoutly obedient to Him.</AYA>
		<AYA id="030027">It is He Who begins the creation; then repeats it; and for Him it is most easy. To Him belongs the loftiest similitude (we can think of) in the heavens and the earth: for He is Exalted in Might, full of wisdom.</AYA>
		<AYA id="030028">He does propound to you a similitude from yourselves: do ye have partners among those whom your right hands possess, to share as equals in the wealth We have bestowed on you? Do ye fear them as ye fear each other? Thus do we explain the Signs in detail to a people that understand.</AYA>
		<AYA id="030029">Nay, the wrong-doers (merely) follow their own desires, being devoid of knowledge. But who will guide those whom Allah leaves astray? To them there will be no helpers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="030030">So set thou thy face truly to the religion being upright; the nature in which Allah has made mankind: no change (there is) in the work (wrought) by Allah: that is the true Religion: but most among mankind know not.</AYA>
		<AYA id="030031">Turn ye back in repentance to Him, and fear Him: establish regular prayers, and be not ye among those who join gods with Allah,-</AYA>
		<AYA id="030032">Those who split up their Religion, and become (mere) Sects,- each party rejoicing in that which is with itself!</AYA>
		<AYA id="030033">When trouble touches men, they cry to their Lord, turning back to Him in repentance: but when He gives them a taste of Mercy as from Himself, behold, some of them pay part-worship to other gods besides their Lord,-</AYA>
		<AYA id="030034">(As if) to show their ingratitude for the (favors) We have bestowed on them! Then enjoy (your brief day); but soon will ye know (your folly).</AYA>
		<AYA id="030035">Or have We sent down authority to them, which speaks to them the things to which they pay part-worship?</AYA>
		<AYA id="030036">When We give men a taste of Mercy, they exult thereat: and when some evil afflicts them because of what their (own) hands have sent forth, behold, they are in despair!</AYA>
		<AYA id="030037">See they not that Allah enlarges the provision and restricts it, to whomsoever He pleases? Verily in that are Signs for those who believe.</AYA>
		<AYA id="030038">So give what is due to kindred, the needy, and the wayfarer. That is best for those who seek the Countenance, of Allah, and it is they who will prosper.</AYA>
		<AYA id="030039">That which you give in usury for increase through the property of (other) people, will have no increase with Allah: but that which you give for charity, seeking the Countenance of Allah, (will increase): it is these who will get a recompense multiplied.</AYA>
		<AYA id="030040">It is Allah Who has created you: further, He has provided for your sustenance; then He will cause you to die; and again He will give you life. Are there any of your (false) "Partners" who can do any single one of these things? Glory to Him! and High is He above the partners they attribute (to him)!</AYA>
		<AYA id="030041">Mischief has appeared on land and sea because of (the meed) that the hands of men have earned, that (Allah) may give them a taste of some of their deeds: in order that they may turn back (from evil).</AYA>
		<AYA id="030042">Say: "Travel through the earth and see what was the end of those before (you): most of them worshipped others besides Allah."</AYA>
		<AYA id="030043">But set thou thy face to the right Religion before there come from Allah the Day which there is no chance of averting: on that Day shall men be divided (in two).</AYA>
		<AYA id="030044">Those who reject Faith will suffer from that rejection: and those who work righteousness will make provisions for themselves (in heaven):</AYA>
		<AYA id="030045">That He may reward those who believe and work righteous deeds, out of His Bounty. For He loves not those who reject Faith.</AYA>
		<AYA id="030046">Among His Signs is this, that He sends the Winds, as heralds of Glad Tidings, giving you a taste of His Mercy,- that the ships may sail by His Command and that ye may seek of His Bounty: in order that ye may be grateful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="030047">We did indeed send, before thee, messengers to their (respective) peoples, and they came to them with Clear Signs: then, to those who transgressed, We meted out Retribution: and it was a duty incumbent upon Us to aid those who believed.</AYA>
		<AYA id="030048">It is Allah Who sends the Winds, and they raise the Clouds: then does He spread them in the sky as He wills, and break them into fragments, until thou seest rain-drops issue from the midst thereof: then when He has made them reach such of His servants as He wills, behold, they do rejoice!-</AYA>
		<AYA id="030049">Even though, before they received (the rain) - just before this - they were dumb with despair!</AYA>
		<AYA id="030050">Then behold (O man!) the tokens of Allah's Mercy!- how He gives life to the earth after its death: verily the same will give life to the men who are dead: for He has power over all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="030051">And if We (but) send a Wind from which they see (their tilth) turn yellow,- behold, they become, thereafter, Ungrateful (Unbelievers)!</AYA>
		<AYA id="030052">So verily thou canst not make the dead to hear, nor canst thou make the deaf to hear the call, when they show their backs and turn away.</AYA>
		<AYA id="030053">Nor canst thou lead back the blind from their straying: only those wilt thou make to hear, who believe in Our signs and submit (their wills in Islm).</AYA>
		<AYA id="030054">It is Allah Who created you in a state of (helpless) weakness, then gave (you) strength after weakness, then, after strength, gave (you) weakness and a hoary head: He creates whatever He wills, and it is He Who has all knowledge and power.</AYA>
		<AYA id="030055">On the Day that the Hour (of Reckoning) will be established, the transgressors will swear that they tarried not but an hour: thus were they used to being deluded!</AYA>
		<AYA id="030056">But those endued with knowledge and faith will say: "Indeed ye did tarry, within Allah's Decree, to the Day of Resurrection, and this is the Day of Resurrection: but ye - ye did not know!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="030057">So on that Day no excuse of theirs will avail the transgressors, nor will they be allowed to make amends.</AYA>
		<AYA id="030058">Verily We have propounded for men, in this Quran every kind of Parable: but if thou bring to them any Sign, the Unbelievers are sure to say, "Ye do nothing but talk vanities."</AYA>
		<AYA id="030059">Thus does Allah seal up the hearts of those who understand not.</AYA>
		<AYA id="030060">So patiently persevere: for verily the promise of Allah is true: nor let those excite thee, who have (themselves) no certainty of faith.</AYA>

		<AYA id="031020">Do ye not see that Allah has subjected to your (use) all things in the heavens and on earth, and has made His bounties flow to you in exceeding measure, (both) seen and unseen? Yet there are among men those who dispute about Allah, without knowledge and without guidance, and without a Book to enlighten them!</AYA>
		<AYA id="031021">When they are told to follow the (Revelation) that Allah has sent down, they say: "Nay, we shall follow the ways that we found our fathers (following). "What! even if it is Satan beckoning them to the Chastisement of the (Blazing) Fire?</AYA>

		<AYA id="032012">If only thou couldst see when the guilty ones will bend low their heads before their Lord, (saying:) "Our Lord! We have seen and we have heard: Now then send us back (to the world): we will work righteousness: for we do indeed (now) believe."</AYA>
		<AYA id="032013">If We had so willed, We could certainly have brought every soul its true guidance: but the Word from Me will come true, "I will fill Hell with Jinns and men all together."</AYA>

		<AYA id="033001">O Prophet! Fear Allah, and hearken not to the Unbelievers and the Hypocrites: verily Allah is full of Knowledge and Wisdom.</AYA>
		<AYA id="033002">But follow that which comes to thee by inspiration from thy Lord: for Allah is well acquainted with (all) that ye do.</AYA>
		<AYA id="033003">And put thy trust in Allah, and enough is Allah as a disposer of affairs.</AYA>
		<AYA id="033004">Allah has not made for any man two hearts in his breast: nor has He made your wives whom ye divorce by Zihr your mothers: nor has He made your adopted sons your sons. Such is (only) your (manner of) speech by your mouths. But Allah tells (you) the Truth, and He shows the (right) Way.</AYA>
		<AYA id="033005">Call them by their fathers: that is juster in the sight of Allah. But if ye know not their father's names, (then they are) your brothers in faith, or your friends. But there is no blame on you if ye make a mistake therein: (what counts is) the intention of your hearts: and Allah is Oft-Returning, Most Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="033006">The Prophet is closer to the Believers than their own selves, and his wives are their mothers. Blood-relations among each other have closer personal ties, in the Book of Allah. Than (the Brotherhood of) Believers and Muhjirs: nevertheless do ye what is just to your closest friends: such is the writing in the Book (of Allah).</AYA>
		<AYA id="033007">And remember We took from the Prophets their Covenant: As from thee: from Noah, Abraham, Moses, and Jesus the son of Mary: We took from them a solemn covenant:</AYA>
		<AYA id="033008">That (Allah) may question the Truthful about their truthfulness: and He has prepared for the Unbelievers a grievous Penalty.</AYA>
		<AYA id="033009">O ye who believe! Remember the Grace of Allah, (bestowed) on you, when there came down on you hosts (to overwhelm you): But We sent against them a hurricane and forces that ye saw not: but Allah sees (clearly) all that ye do.</AYA>
		<AYA id="033010">Behold! they came on you from above you and from below you, and behold, the eyes swerved and the hearts gaped up to the throats, and ye imagined various (vain) thoughts about Allah!</AYA>
		<AYA id="033011">In that situation were the Believers tried: they were shaken as by a tremendous shaking.</AYA>
		<AYA id="033012">And behold! The Hypocrites and those in whose hearts is a disease (even) say: "Allah and His Messenger promised us nothing but delusion!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="033013">Behold! A party among them said: "Ye men of Yathrib! Ye cannot stand (the attack)! therefore go back!" And a band of them ask for leave of the Prophet, saying, "Truly our houses are bare and exposed," though they were not exposed: they intended nothing but to run away.</AYA>
		<AYA id="033014">And if an entry had been effected to them from the sides of the (City), and they had been incited to sedition, they would certainly have brought it to pass, with none but a brief delay!</AYA>
		<AYA id="033015">And yet they had already covenanted with Allah not to turn their backs, and a covenant with Allah must (surely) be answered for.</AYA>
		<AYA id="033016">Say: "Running away will not profit you if ye are running away from death or slaughter; and even if (ye do escape), no more than a brief (respite) will ye be allowed to enjoy!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="033017">Say: "Who is it that can screen you from Allah if it be His wish to give you punishment or to give you Mercy?" Nor will they find for themselves, besides Allah, any protector or helper.</AYA>
		<AYA id="033018">Verily Allah knows those among you who keep back (men) and those who say to their brethren, "Come along to us", but come not to the fight except for just a little while.</AYA>
		<AYA id="033019">Covetous over you. Then when fear comes, thou wilt see them looking to thee, their eyes revolving, like one who faints from death: but when the fear is past, they will smite you with sharp tongues, covetous of goods. Such men have no faith, and so Allah has made their deeds of none effect: and that is easy for Allah.</AYA>
		<AYA id="033020">They think that the Confederates have not withdrawn; and if the Confederates should come (again), they would wish they were in the deserts (wandering) among the Bedouins, and seeking news about you (from a safe distance); and if they were in your midst, they would fight but little.</AYA>
		<AYA id="033021">Ye have indeed in the Messenger of Allah an excellent exempler for him who hopes in Allah and the Final Day, and who remembers Allah.</AYA>
		<AYA id="033022">When the Believers saw the Confederate forces, they said: "This is what Allah and His Messenger had promised us, and Allah and His Messenger told us what was true." And it only added to their faith and their zeal in obedience.</AYA>
		<AYA id="033023">Among the Believers are men who have been true to their covenant with Allah: of them some have died, and some (still) wait: but they have never changed (their determination) in the least:</AYA>
		<AYA id="033024">That Allah may reward the men of Truth for their Truth, and punish the Hypocrites if that be His Will, or turn to them in Mercy: for Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="033025">And Allah turned back the Unbelievers for (all) their fury: no advantage did they gain; and enough is Allah for the Believers in their fight. And Allah is Full of Strength, Exalted in Might.</AYA>
		<AYA id="033026">And those of the People of the Book who aided them - Allah did take them down from their strongholds and cast terror into their hearts. (So that) some ye slew, and some ye made captives.</AYA>
		<AYA id="033027">And He made you heirs of their lands, their houses, and their goods, and of a land which ye had not frequented (before). And Allah has power over all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="033028">O Prophet! Say to thy Consorts: "If it be that ye desire the life of this World, and its glitter,- then come! I will provide for your enjoyment and set you free in a handsome manner.</AYA>
		<AYA id="033029">But if ye seek Allah and His Messenger, and the Home of the Hereafter, verily Allah has prepared for the well-doers amongst you a great reward.</AYA>
		<AYA id="033030">O Consorts of the Prophet! If any of you were guilty of evident unseemly conduct, the Punishment would be doubled to her, and that is easy for Allah.</AYA>
		<AYA id="033031">But any of you that is devout in the service of Allah and His Messenger, and works righteousness,- to her shall We grant her reward twice: and We have prepared for her a generous Sustenance.</AYA>
		<AYA id="033032">O Consorts of the Prophet! Ye are not like any of the (other) women: if ye do fear (Allah), be not too complacent of speech, lest one in whose heart is a disease should be moved with desire: but speak ye a speech (that is) just.</AYA>
		<AYA id="033033">And stay quietly in your houses, and make not a dazzling display, like that of the former Times of Ignorance; and establish regular prayer, and give Zakat; and obey Allah and His Messenger. And Allah only wishes to remove all abomination from you, ye members of the Family, and to make you pure and spotless.</AYA>
		<AYA id="033034">And recite what is rehearsed to you in your homes, of the Signs of Allah and His Wisdom: for Allah is All-Subtle, All-Aware.</AYA>
		<AYA id="033035">For Muslim men and women,- for believing men and women, for devout men and women, for true men and women, for men and women who are patient and constant, for men and women who humble themselves, for men and women who give in charity, for men and women who fast, for men and women who guard their chastity, and for men and women who engage much in Allah's remembrance,- for them has Allah prepared forgiveness and great reward.</AYA>
		<AYA id="033036">It is not fitting for a Believer, man or woman, when a matter has been decided by Allah and His Messenger to have any option about their decision: if any one disobeys Allah and His Messenger, he is indeed on a clearly wrong Path.</AYA>
		<AYA id="033037">Behold! Thou didst say to one who had received the grace of Allah and thy favor: "Retain thou (in wedlock) thy wife, and fear Allah." But thou didst hide in thy heart that which Allah was about to make manifest: thou didst fear the people, but it is more fitting that thou shouldst fear Allah. Then when Zaid had dissolved (his marriage) with her, We joined her in marriage to thee: in order that (in future) there may be no difficulty to the Believers in (the matter of) marriage with the wives of their adopted sons, when the latter have dissolved (their marriage) with them. And Allah's command must be fulfilled.</AYA>
		<AYA id="033038">There can be no difficulty to the Prophet in what Allah has indicated to him as a duty. It was the practice (approved) of Allah amongst those of old that have passed away. And the command of Allah is a decree determined.</AYA>
		<AYA id="033039">(It is the practice of those) who preach the Messages of Allah, and fear Him, and fear none but Allah. And enough is Allah to call (men) to account.</AYA>
		<AYA id="033040">Muhammad is not the father of any of your men, but (he is) the Messenger of Allah, and the Seal of the Prophets: and Allah has full knowledge of all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="033041">O ye who believe! Remember Allah with much remembrance;</AYA>
		<AYA id="033042">And glorify Him morning and evening.</AYA>
		<AYA id="033043">He it is Who sends blessings on you, as do His angels, that He may bring you out from the depths of Darkness into Light: and He is Full of Mercy to the Believers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="033044">Their salutation on the Day they meet Him will be "Peace!"; and He has prepared for them a generous Reward.</AYA>
		<AYA id="033045">O Prophet! Truly We have sent thee as a Witness, a Bearer of Glad Tidings, and Warner,-</AYA>
		<AYA id="033046">And as one who invites to Allah's (Grace) by His leave, and as a Lamp spreading Light.</AYA>
		<AYA id="033047">Then give the Glad Tidings to the Believers, that they shall have from Allah a very great Bounty.</AYA>
		<AYA id="033048">And obey not (the behests) of the Unbelievers and the Hypocrites, and disregard their insolence, but put thy trust in Allah. For enough is Allah as a Disposer of affairs.</AYA>
		<AYA id="033049">O ye who believe! When ye marry believing women, and then divorce them before ye have touched them, no period of ddah have ye to count in respect of them: so give them a present, and release them in a handsome manner.</AYA>
		<AYA id="033050">O Prophet! We have made lawful to thee thy wives to whom thou hast paid their dowers; and those whom thy right hand possesses out of the captives of war whom Allah has assigned to thee; and daughters of thy paternal uncles and aunts, and daughters of thy maternal uncles and aunts, who migrated (from Makkah) with thee; and any believing woman who gives herself to the Prophet if the Prophet wishes to wed her;- this only for thee, and not for the Believers (at large); We know what We have appointed for them as to their wives and the captives whom their right hands possess;- in order that there should be no difficulty for thee. And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="033051">Thou mayest defer (the turn of) any of them that thou pleasest, and thou mayest receive any thou pleasest: and there is no blame on thee if thou invite one whose (turn) thou hadst set aside. This were nigher to the cooling of their eyes, the prevention of their grief, and their satisfaction - that of all of them - with that which thou hast to give them: and Allah knows (all) that is in your hearts: and Allah is All- Knowing, Most Forbearing.</AYA>
		<AYA id="033052">It is not lawful for thee (to marry more) women after this, nor to change them for (other) wives, even though their beauty attract thee, except any thy right hand should possess (as handmaidens): and Allah doth watch over all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="033053">O ye who believe! Enter not the Prophet's houses,- until leave is given you,- for a meal, (and then) not (so early as) to wait for its preparation: but when ye are invited, enter; and when ye have taken your meal, disperse, without seeking familiar talk. Such (behavior) annoys the Prophet: he is shy to dismiss you, but Allah is not shy (to tell you) the truth. And when ye ask (his ladies) for anything ye want, ask them from before a screen: that makes for greater purity for your hearts and for theirs. Nor is it right for you that ye should annoy Allah's Messenger, or that ye should marry his widows after him at any time. Truly such a thing is in Allah's sight an enormity.</AYA>
		<AYA id="033054">Whether ye reveal anything or conceal it, verily Allah has full knowledge of all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="033055">There is no blame (on these ladies if they appear) before their fathers or their sons, their brothers, or their brother's sons, or their sisters' sons, or their women, or the (slaves) whom their right hands possess. And, (ladies), fear Allah. for Allah is Witness to all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="033056">Allah and His angels send blessings on the Prophet: O ye that believe! Send ye blessings on him, and salute him with all respect.</AYA>
		<AYA id="033057">Those who annoy Allah and His Messenger - Allah has cursed them in this world and in the Hereafter, and has prepared for them a humiliating punishment.</AYA>
		<AYA id="033058">And those who annoy believing men and women undeservedly, bear (on themselves) a calumny and a glaring sin.</AYA>
		<AYA id="033059">O Prophet! Tell thy wives and daughters, and the believing women, that they should cast their outer garments over their persons (when out of doors): that is most convenient, that they should be known (as such) and not molested. And Allah is Oft- Forgiving, Most Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="033060">Truly, if the Hypocrites, and those in whose hearts is a disease, and those who stir up sedition in the City, desist not, We shall certainly stir thee up against them: then will they not be able to stay in it as thy neighbors for any length of time:</AYA>
		<AYA id="033061">They shall have a curse on them: whenever they are found, they shall be seized and slain.</AYA>
		<AYA id="033062">(Such was) the practice (approved) of Allah among those who lived aforetime: no change wilt thou find in the practice (approved) of Allah.</AYA>
		<AYA id="033063">Men ask thee concerning the Hour: Say, "The knowledge thereof is with Allah (alone)": and what will make thee understand?- perchance the Hour is nigh!</AYA>
		<AYA id="033064">Verily Allah has cursed the Unbelievers and prepared for them a Blazing Fire,-</AYA>
		<AYA id="033065">To dwell therein for ever: no protector will they find, nor helper.</AYA>
		<AYA id="033066">The Day that their faces will be turned over in the Fire, they will say: "Woe to us! Would that we had obeyed Allah and obeyed the Messenger!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="033067">And they would say: "Our Lord! We obeyed our chiefs and our great ones, and they misled us as to the (right) path.</AYA>
		<AYA id="033068">"Our Lord! Give them double Chastisement and curse them with a very great Curse!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="033069">O ye who believe! Be ye not like those who hurt Moses, but Allah cleared him of the (calumnies) they had uttered: and he was honorable in Allah's sight.</AYA>
		<AYA id="033070">O ye who believe! Fear Allah, and make your utterance straight forward:</AYA>
		<AYA id="033071">That He may make your conduct whole and sound, and forgive you your sins: He that obeys Allah and His Messenger, has already attained the great victory.</AYA>
		<AYA id="033072">We did indeed offer the Trust to the Heavens and the Earth and the Mountains; but they refused to undertake it, being afraid thereof: but man undertook it;- He was indeed unjust and foolish;-</AYA>
		<AYA id="033073">(With the result) that Allah has to punish the Hypocrites, men and women, and the Unbelievers, men and women, and Allah turns in Mercy to the Believers, men and women: for Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.</AYA>

		<AYA id="034004">That He may reward those who believe and work deeds of righteousness: for such is Forgiveness and a Sustenance Most Generous."</AYA>
		<AYA id="034005">But those who strive against Our Signs, to frustrate them,- for such will be a Chastisement,- of painful wrath.</AYA>
		<AYA id="034006">And those to whom knowledge has come see that the (Revelation) sent down to thee from thy Lord - that is the Truth, and that it guides to the Path of the Exalted (in Might), Worthy of all praise.</AYA>
		<AYA id="034007">The Unbelievers say (in ridicule): "Shall we point out to you a man that will tell you, when ye are all scattered to pieces in disintegration, that ye shall (then be raised) in a New Creation?</AYA>
		<AYA id="034008">"Has he invented a falsehood against Allah, or is he afflicted with madness?" - Nay, it is those who believe not in the Hereafter, that are in (real) Chastisement, and in farthest error.</AYA>
		<AYA id="034009">See they not what is before them and behind them, of the sky and the earth? If We wished, We could cause the earth to swallow them up, or cause a piece of the sky to fall upon them. Verily in this is a Sign for every devotee that turns to Allah (in repentance).</AYA>
		<AYA id="034010">We bestowed Grace aforetime on David from Us: "O ye Mountains! Sing ye back the Praises of Allah with him! and ye birds (also)! And We made the iron soft for him;-</AYA>
		<AYA id="034011">(Commanding), "Make thou coats of mail, balancing well the rings of chain armor, and work ye righteousness; for be sure I see (clearly) all that ye do."</AYA>
		<AYA id="034012">And to Solomon (We made) the Wind (obedient): its early morning (stride) was a month's (journey), and its evening (stride) was a month's (journey); and We made a Font of molten brass to flow for him; and there were Jinns that worked in front of him, by the leave of his Lord, and if any of them turned aside from Our command, We made him taste of the Chastisement of the Blazing Fire.</AYA>
		<AYA id="034013">They worked for him as he desired, (making) arches, images, basons as large as wells, and (cooking) cauldrons fixed (in their places): "Exercise thanks, sons of David! but few of My servants are grateful!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="034014">Then, when We decreed (Solomon's) death, nothing showed them his death except a little worm of the earth, which kept (slowly) gnawing away at his staff: so when he fell down, the Jinns saw plainly that if they had known the unseen, they would not have tarried in the humiliating Chastisement (of their Task).</AYA>
		<AYA id="034015">There was, for Sab, aforetime, a Sign in their home-land - two Gardens to the right and to the left. "Eat of the Sustenance (provided) by your Lord, and be grateful to Him: a territory fair and happy, and a Lord Oft-Forgiving!</AYA>
		<AYA id="034016">But they turned away (from Allah), and We sent against them the Flood (released) from the dams, and We converted their two garden (rows) into "gardens" producing bitter fruit, and tamarisks, and some few (stunted) Lote-trees.</AYA>
		<AYA id="034017">That was the Requital We gave them because they ungratefully rejected Faith: and never do We give (such) requital except to such as are ungrateful rejecters.</AYA>
		<AYA id="034018">Between them and the Cities on which We had poured Our blessings, We had placed Cities in prominent positions, and between them We had appointed stages of journey in due proportion: "Travel therein, secure, by night and by day."</AYA>
		<AYA id="034019">But they said: "Our Lord! Place longer distances between our journey- stages": but they wronged themselves (therein). At length We made them as a tale (that is told), and We dispersed them all in scattered fragments. Verily in this are Signs for every (soul that is) patiently constant and grateful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="034020">And on them did Satan prove true his idea, and they followed him, all but a party that believed.</AYA>
		<AYA id="034021">But he had no authority over them,- except that We might test the man who believes in the Hereafter from him who is in doubt concerning it: and thy Lord doth watch over all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="034022">Say: "Call upon other (gods) whom ye fancy, besides Allah. They have no power,- not the weight of an atom,- in the heavens or on earth: no (sort of) share have they therein, nor is any of them a helper to Allah.</AYA>
		<AYA id="034023">"No intercession can avail in with Him, except for those for whom He has granted permission.

		<AYA id="034029">They say: "When will this promise (come to pass) if ye are telling the truth?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="034030">Say: "The appointment to you is for a Day, which ye cannot put back for an hour nor put forward."</AYA>
		<AYA id="034031">The Unbelievers say: "We shall neither believe in this scripture nor in (any) that (came) before it." Couldst thou but see when the wrong-doers will be made to stand before their Lord, throwing back the word (of blame) on one another! Those who were deemed weak will say to the arrogant ones: "Had it not been for you, we should certainly have been believers!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="034032">The arrogant ones will say to those who had been despised weak: "Was it we who kept you back from Guidance after it reached you? Nay, rather, it was ye who transgressed.</AYA>
		<AYA id="034033">Those who had been deemed weak will say to the arrogant ones: "Nay! it was a plot (of yours) by day and by night: Behold! Ye (constantly) ordered us to be ungrateful to Allah and to attribute equals to Him!" They are filled with remorse, when they see the Chastisement: We shall put yokes on the necks of the Unbelievers: It would only be a requital for their (ill) Deeds.</AYA>
		<AYA id="034034">Never did We send a warner to a population, but the wealthy ones among them said: "We believe not in the (Message) with which ye have been sent."</AYA>
		<AYA id="034035">They said: "We have more in wealth and in sons, and we cannot be chastised."</AYA>
		<AYA id="034036">Say: "Verily my Lord enlarges and restricts the Provision to whom He pleases, but most men know not."</AYA>
		<AYA id="034037">It is not your wealth nor your sons, that will bring you nearer to Us in degree: but only those who believe and work righteousness - these are the ones for whom there is a multiplied Reward for their deeds, while secure they (reside) in the dwellings on high!</AYA>
		<AYA id="034038">Those who strive against Our Signs, to frustrate them, will be given over into chastisement.</AYA>
		<AYA id="034039">Say: "Verily my Lord enlarges and restricts the Sustenance to such of His servants as He pleases: and nothing do ye spend in the least (in His cause) but He replaces it: for He is the Best of those who grant Sustenance.</AYA>
		<AYA id="034040">On the Day He will gather them all together, and say to the angels, "Was it you that these men used to worship?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="034041">They will say, "Glory to Thee! Thou art our Protector - not them. Nay, but they worshipped the Jinns: most of them believed in them."</AYA>
		<AYA id="034042">So on that Day no power shall they have over each other, for profit or harm: and We shall say to the wrong-doers, "Taste ye the Chastisement of the Fire,- the which ye were wont to deny!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="034043">When Our Clear Signs are rehearsed to them, they say, "This is only a man who wishes to hinder you from the (worship) which your fathers practiced." And they say, "This is only a falsehood invented!" and the Unbelievers say of the Truth when it comes to them, "This is nothing but evident magic!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="034044">But We had not given them Books which they could study, nor sent messengers to them before thee as Warners.</AYA>
		<AYA id="034045">And their predecessors rejected (the Truth); these have not received a tenth of what We had granted to those: yet when they rejected My messengers, how (terrible) was My punishment!</AYA>
		<AYA id="034046">Say: "I do admonish you on one point: that ye do stand up before Allah,- (It may be) in pairs, or (it may be) singly,- and reflect (within yourselves): your Companion is not possessed: he is no less than a warner to you, in face of a terrible chastisement."</AYA>
		<AYA id="034047">Say: "Whatever reward do I ask of you, it is yours: my reward is only due from Allah. And He is witness to all things."</AYA>
		<AYA id="034048">Say: "Verily my Lord doth cast the Truth,- He that has full knowledge of (all) that is hidden."</AYA>
		<AYA id="034049">Say: "The Truth has arrived, and Falsehood showeth not its face, and will not return."</AYA>
		<AYA id="034050">Say: "If I am astray, I only stray to the loss of my own soul: but if I receive guidance, it is because of the inspiration of my Lord to me: it is He Who hears all things, and is (ever) near."</AYA>
		<AYA id="034051">If thou couldst but see when they will quake with terror; but then there will be no escape (for them), and they will be seized from a position (quite) near.</AYA>
		<AYA id="034052">And they will say, "We do believe (now) in the (Truth)"; but how could they receive (Faith) from a position (so) far off,-</AYA>
		<AYA id="034053">Seeing that they did reject Faith before, and that they cast (conjectures) with regard on the unseen from a position far off?</AYA>
		<AYA id="034054">And between them and their desires, is placed a barrier, as was done in the past with their partisans: for they were indeed in suspicious (disquieting) doubt.</AYA>

		<AYA id="035008">Is he, then, to whom the evil of his conduct is made alluring, so that he looks upon it as good, (equal to one who is rightly guided)? For Allah leaves to stray whom He wills, and guides whom He wills. So let not thy soul be vested in regret for them: for Allah knows well all that they do!</AYA>
		<AYA id="035009">It is Allah Who sends forth the Winds, so that they raise up the Clouds, and We drive them to a land that is dead, and revive the earth therewith after its death: even so (will be) the Resurrection!</AYA>

Now are they but looking for the way the ancients were dealt with? But no change wilt thou find in Allah's way (of dealing): no turning off wilt thou find in Allah's way (of dealing).</AYA>
		<AYA id="035044">Do they not travel through the earth, and see what was the End of those before them,- though they were superior to them in strength? Nor is Allah to be frustrated by anything whatever in the heavens or on earth: for He is All-Knowing. All-Powerful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="035045">If Allah were to punish men according to what they deserve. He would not leave on the back of the (earth) a single living creature: but He gives them respite for a stated Term: when their Term expires, verily Allah has in His sight all His Servants.</AYA>

		<AYA id="036001">Y Sn.</AYA>
		<AYA id="036002">By the Quran, full of Wisdom,-</AYA>
		<AYA id="036003">Thou art indeed one of the messengers,</AYA>
		<AYA id="036004">On a Straight Way.</AYA>
		<AYA id="036005">(It is a Revelation) sent down by (Him), the Exalted in Might, Most Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="036006">In order that thou mayest warn a people, whose fathers were not warned, and who therefore remain heedless (of the Signs of Allah).</AYA>
		<AYA id="036007">The Word is proved true against the greater part of them: for they do not believe.</AYA>
		<AYA id="036008">We have put yokes round their necks right up to their chins, so that they cannot bow their heads.</AYA>
		<AYA id="036009">And We have put a bar in front of them and a bar behind them, and further, We have covered them up; so that they cannot see.</AYA>
		<AYA id="036010">The same is it to them whether thou admonish them or thou do not admonish them: they will not believe.</AYA>
		<AYA id="036011">Thou canst but admonish such a one as follows the Message and fears the (Lord) Most Gracious, unseen: give such a one, therefore, good tidings, of Forgiveness and a Reward most generous.</AYA>
		<AYA id="036012">Verily We shall give life to the dead, and We record that which they send before and that which they leave behind, and of all things have We taken account in a clear Book (of evidence).</AYA>
		<AYA id="036013">Set forth to them, by way of a parable, the (story of) the Companions of the City. Behold!, there came messengers to it.</AYA>
		<AYA id="036014">When We (first) sent to them two messengers, they rejected them: but We strengthened them with a third: they said, "Truly, we have been sent on a mission to you."</AYA>
		<AYA id="036015">The (people) said: "Ye are only men like ourselves; and the Most Gracious sends no sort of revelation: ye do nothing but lie."</AYA>
		<AYA id="036016">They said: "Our Lord doth know that we have been sent on a mission to you:</AYA>
		<AYA id="036017">"And our duty is only to deliver the clear Message."</AYA>
		<AYA id="036018">The (people) said: "For us, we augur an evil omen from you: if ye desist not, we will certainly stone you. And a grievous punishment indeed will be inflicted on you by us."</AYA>
		<AYA id="036019">They said: "Your evil omens are with yourselves: (deem ye this an evil omen). If ye are admonished? Nay, but ye are a people transgressing all bounds!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="036020">Then there came running, from the farthest part of the City, a man, saying, "O my people! Obey the messengers:</AYA>
		<AYA id="036021">"Obey those who ask no reward of you (for themselves), and who are themselves guided.</AYA>
		<AYA id="036022">"Why should I not serve Him Who created me, and to Whom ye shall (all) be brought back.</AYA>
		<AYA id="036023">"Shall I take (other) gods besides Him? If the Most Gracious should intend some adversity for me, of no use whatever will be their intercession for me, nor can they deliver me.</AYA>
		<AYA id="036024">"I would indeed, then so, be in manifest Error.</AYA>
		<AYA id="036025">"For me, I have faith in the Lord of you (all): listen, then, to me!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="036026">It was said: "Enter thou the Garden." He said: "Ah me! Would that my People knew (what I know)!-</AYA>
		<AYA id="036027">"For that my Lord has granted me Forgiveness and has enrolled me among those held in honor!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="036028">And We sent not down against his People, after him, any hosts from heaven, nor was it needful for Us so to do 1000 .</AYA>
		<AYA id="036029">It was no more than a single mighty Blast, and behold! they were (like ashes) quenched and silent.</AYA>
		<AYA id="036030">Ah! Alas for the Servants! There comes not a messenger to them but they mock him!</AYA>
		<AYA id="036031">See they not how many generations before them we destroyed? Not to them will they return:</AYA>
		<AYA id="036032">But each one of them all - will be brought before Us (for judgment).</AYA>
		<AYA id="036033">A Sign for them is the earth that is dead: We do give it life, and produce grain therefrom, of which ye do eat.</AYA>
		<AYA id="036034">And We produce therein orchard with date-palms and vines, and We cause springs to gush forth therein:</AYA>
		<AYA id="036035">That they may enjoy the fruits of this (artistry): It was not their hands that made this: will they not then give thanks?</AYA>
		<AYA id="036036">Glory to Allah, Who created in pairs all things that the earth produces, as well as their own (human) kind and (other) things of which they have no knowledge.</AYA>
		<AYA id="036037">And a Sign for them is the Night: We withdraw therefrom the Day, and behold they are plunged in darkness;</AYA>
		<AYA id="036038">And the Sun runs unto a resting place: that is the decree of (Him), the Exalted in Might, the All-Knowing.</AYA>
		<AYA id="036039">And the Moon,- We have measured for her stations (to traverse) till she returns like the old (and withered) lower part of a date-stalk.</AYA>
		<AYA id="036040">It is not permitted to the Sun to catch up the Moon, nor can the Night outstrip the Day: each (just) swims along in (its own) orbit (according to Law).</AYA>
		<AYA id="036041">And a Sign for them is that We bore their race (through the Flood) in the loaded Ark;</AYA>
		<AYA id="036042">And We have created for them similar (vessels) on which they ride.</AYA>
		<AYA id="036043">If it were Our Will, We could drown them: then would there be no helper (to hear their cry), nor could they be delivered,</AYA>
		<AYA id="036044">Except by way of Mercy from Us, and by way of (world) convenience (to serve them) for a time.</AYA>
		<AYA id="036045">When they are told, "Fear ye that which is before you and that which will be after you, in order that ye may receive Mercy," (they turn back).</AYA>
		<AYA id="036046">Not a Sign comes to them from among the Signs of their Lord, but they turn away therefrom.</AYA>
		<AYA id="036047">And when they are told, "Spend ye of (the bounties) with which Allah has provided you," the Unbelievers say to those who believe: "Shall we then feed those whom, if Allah had so willed, He would have fed, (Himself)?- Ye are in nothing but manifest error."</AYA>
		<AYA id="036048">Further, they say, "When will this promise (come to pass), if what ye say is true?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="036049">They will not (have to) wait for aught but a single Blast: it will seize them while they are yet disputing among themselves!</AYA>
		<AYA id="036050">No (chance) will they then have, by will, to dispose (of their affairs), nor to return to their own people!</AYA>
		<AYA id="036051">The trumpet shall be sounded, when behold! from the sepulchers (men) will rush forth to their Lord!</AYA>
		<AYA id="036052">They will say: "Ah! Woe unto us! Who hath raised us up from our beds of repose?"... (A voice will say:) "This is what the Most Gracious had promised. And true was the word of the messengers!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="036053">It will be no more than a single Blast, when lo! they will all be brought up before Us!</AYA>
		<AYA id="036054">Then, on that Day, not a soul will be wronged in the least, and ye shall but be repaid the meeds of your past Deeds.</AYA>
		<AYA id="036055">Verily the Companions of the Garden shall that Day have joy in all that they do;</AYA>
		<AYA id="036056">They and their associates will be in pleasant shade, reclining on raised couches;</AYA>
		<AYA id="036057">(Every) fruit will be there for them; they shall have whatever they call for;</AYA>
		<AYA id="036058">"Peace!" - a word (of salutation) from a Lord Most Merciful!</AYA>
		<AYA id="036059">"And O ye in sin! Get ye apart this Day!</AYA>
		<AYA id="036060">"Did I not enjoin on you, O ye Children of Adam, that ye should not worship Satan; for that he was to you an enemy avowed?-</AYA>
		<AYA id="036061">"And that ye should worship Me; (for that) this was the Straight Way?</AYA>
		<AYA id="036062">"But he did lead astray a great multitude of you. Did ye not, then, understand?</AYA>
		<AYA id="036063">"This is the Hell of which ye were promised!</AYA>
		<AYA id="036064">"Embrace ye the (Fire) this Day, for that ye (persistently) rejected (Truth)."</AYA>
		<AYA id="036065">That Day shall We set a seal on their mouths. But their hands will speak to us, and their feet bear witness, to all that they did.</AYA>
		<AYA id="036066">If it had been Our Will, We could surely have blotted out their eyes; then should they have raced to the Path, but how could they have seen?</AYA>
		<AYA id="036067">And if it had been Our Will, We could have transformed them in their places; then should they have been unable to move about, nor could they have returned (after error).</AYA>
		<AYA id="036068">If We grant long life to any, We cause him to be reversed in nature: Will they not then understand?</AYA>
		<AYA id="036069">We have not instructed the (Prophet) in Poetry, nor is it meet for him: this is no less than a Message and a Quran making things clear:</AYA>
		<AYA id="036070">That it may give admonition to any (who are) alive, and that the word may be proved true against those who reject (Truth).</AYA>
		<AYA id="036071">See they not that it is We Who have created for them - among the things which Our hands have fashioned - cattle, which are under their dominion?-</AYA>
		<AYA id="036072">And that We have subjected them to their (use)? Of them some do carry them and some they eat:</AYA>
		<AYA id="036073">And they have (other) profits from them (besides), and they get (milk) to drink. Will they not then be grateful?</AYA>
		<AYA id="036074">Yet they take (for worship) gods other than Allah, (hoping) that they might be helped!</AYA>
		<AYA id="036075">They have not the power to help them: and they are a host brought up before them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="036076">Let not their speech, then, grieve thee. Verily We know what they hide as well as what they disclose.</AYA>
		<AYA id="036077">Doth not man see that it is We Who created him from sperm? Yet behold! he (stands forth) as an open adversary!</AYA>
		<AYA id="036078">And he makes comparisons for Us, and forgets his own (origin and) Creation: he says, "Who can give life to (dry) bones and decomposed ones (at that)?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="036079">Say, "He will give them life Who created them for the first time! For He fully knows all!-</AYA>
		<AYA id="036080">"The same Who produces for you fire out of the green tree, when behold! ye kindle therewith (your own fires)!</AYA>
		<AYA id="036081">"Is not He Who created the heavens and the earth able to create the like thereof?" - Yea, indeed! for He is the Creator Supreme, of skill and knowledge (infinite)!</AYA>
		<AYA id="036082">Verily, when He intends a thing, His Command is, "Be", and it is!</AYA>
		<AYA id="036083">So glory to Him in Whose Hands is the dominion of all things: and to Him will ye be all brought back.</AYA>

		<AYA id="037093">Then did he turn upon them, striking (them) with the right hand.</AYA>
		<AYA id="037094">Then came (the worshippers) with hurried steps, to him.</AYA>
		<AYA id="037095">He said: "Worship ye that which ye have (yourselves) carved?</AYA>

		<AYA id="037102">Then, when (the son) reached (the age of) (serious) work with him, he said: "O my son! I have seen in a vision that I offer thee in sacrifice: now see what is thy view!" (The son) said: "O my father! Do as thou art commanded: thou will find me, if Allah so wills, one of the steadfast!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="037103">So when they had both submitted (to Allah), and he had laid him prostrate on his forehead (for sacrifice),</AYA>
		<AYA id="037104">We called out to him "O Abraham! ...</AYA>
		<AYA id="037105">"Thou hast already fulfilled the vision!" - thus indeed do We reward those who do right.</AYA>
		<AYA id="037106">For this was a clear trial-</AYA>
		<AYA id="037107">And We ransomed him with a momentous sacrifice:</AYA>
		<AYA id="037108">And We left for him among generations (to come) in later times:</AYA>
		<AYA id="037109">"Peace and salutation to Abraham!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="037110">Thus indeed do We reward those who do right.</AYA>
		<AYA id="037111">For he was one of Our believing Servants.</AYA>
		<AYA id="037112">And We gave him the good news of Isaac - a prophet,- one of the Righteous.</AYA>
		<AYA id="037113">We blessed him and Isaac: but of their progeny are (some) that do right, and (some) that obviously do wrong, to themselves.</AYA>
		<AYA id="037114">Again (of old) We bestowed Our favor on Moses and Aaron,</AYA>

		<AYA id="037121">Thus indeed do We reward those who do right.</AYA>
		<AYA id="037122">For they were two of Our believing Servants.</AYA>
		<AYA id="037123">So also was Elias among those sent (by Us).</AYA>
		<AYA id="037124">Behold, he said to his people, "Will ye not fear (Allah)?</AYA>
		<AYA id="037125">"Will ye call upon Baal and forsake the Best of Creators,-</AYA>

		<AYA id="037136">Then We destroyed the rest.</AYA>
		<AYA id="037137">Verily, ye pass by their (sites), by day-</AYA>
		<AYA id="037138">And by night: will ye not understand?</AYA>
		<AYA id="037139">So also was Jonah among those sent (by Us).</AYA>
		<AYA id="037140">When he ran away (like a slave from captivity) to the ship (fully) laden,</AYA>

		<AYA id="038001">Sd: by the Quran, Full of Admonition: (this is the Truth).</AYA>

		<AYA id="038004">So they wonder that a Warner has come to them from among themselves! and the Unbelievers say, "This is a sorcerer telling lies!</AYA>
		<AYA id="038005">"Has he made gods (all) into one God? Truly this is a strange thing!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="038006">And the leader among them go away (impatiently), (saying), "Walk ye away, and remain constant to your gods! For this is truly a thing designed (against you)!</AYA>
		<AYA id="038007">"We never heard (the like) of this in the last religion: this is nothing but a made-up tale!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="038008">"What! has the Message been sent to him - (of all persons) among us?"...But they are in doubt concerning My (Own) Message! Nay, they have not yet tasted My Punishment!</AYA>

		<AYA id="038011">They are but a host of confederates, and they will be put to flight.</AYA>
		<AYA id="038012">Before them (were many who) rejected messengers,- the people of Noah, and d, and Pharaoh, the lord of Stakes,</AYA>
		<AYA id="038013">And Thamd, and the people of Lt, and the Companions of the Wood; - such were the Confederates.</AYA>
		<AYA id="038014">Not one (of them) but rejected the messengers, but My punishment came justly and inevitably (on them).</AYA>
		<AYA id="038015">These (today) only wait for a single mighty Blast, which (when it comes) will brook no delay.</AYA>
		<AYA id="038016">They say: "Our Lord! hasten to us our sentence (even) before the Day of Account!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="038017">Have patience at what they say, and remember Our servant David, the man of strength: for he ever turned (in repentance to Allah).</AYA>
		<AYA id="038018">It was We that made the hills declare, in unison with him, Our Praises, at eventide and at break of day,</AYA>
		<AYA id="038019">And the birds gathered (in assemblies): all with him did turn (to Allah).</AYA>
		<AYA id="038020">We strengthened his kingdom, and gave him wisdom and sound judgment in speech and decision.</AYA>
		<AYA id="038021">Has the Story of the Disputants reached thee? Behold, they climbed over the wall of the private chamber;</AYA>
		<AYA id="038022">When they entered to David, and he was terrified of them, they said: "Fear not: we are two disputants, one of whom has wronged the other: decide now between us with truth, and treat us not with injustice, but guide us to the even Path..</AYA>
		<AYA id="038023">"This man is my brother: he has nine and ninety ewes, and I have (but) one: yet he says, 'Commit her to my care,' and he overcame me in the argument"</AYA>
		<AYA id="038024">(David) said: "He has undoubtedly wronged thee in demanding thy (single) ewe to be added to his (flock of) ewes: truly many are the partners (in business) who wrong each other: Not so do those who believe and work deeds of righteousness, and how few are they?"...and David gathered that We had tried him: he asked forgiveness of his Lord, fell down, bowing (in prostration), and turned (to Allah in repentance).</AYA>
		<AYA id="038025">So We forgave him this (lapse): he enjoyed, indeed, a Near Approach to Us, and a beautiful place of (final) Return.</AYA>
		<AYA id="038026">O David! We did indeed make thee a vicegerent on earth: so judge thou between men in truth (and justice): nor follow thou the lust (of thy heart), for it will mislead thee from the Path of Allah: for those who wander astray from the Path of Allah, is a chastisement Grievous, for that they forget the Day of Account.</AYA>
		<AYA id="038027">Not without purpose did We create heaven and earth and all between! That were the thought of Unbelievers! But woe to the Unbelievers because of the Fire (of Hell)!</AYA>
		<AYA id="038028">Shall We treat those who believe and work deeds of righteousness, the same as those who do mischief on earth? Shall We treat those who guard against evil, the same as those who turn aside from the right?</AYA>
		<AYA id="038029">(Here is) a Book which We have sent down unto thee, full of blessings, that they may mediate on its Signs, and that men of understanding may receive admonition.</AYA>
		<AYA id="038030">To David We gave Solomon (for a son),- How excellent is the servant! Ever did he turn (to Us in repentance)!</AYA>
		<AYA id="038031">Behold, there were brought before him, at eventide coursers of the highest breeding, and swift of foot;</AYA>

		<AYA id="038033">"Bring them back to me." Then began he to pass his hand over (their) legs and their necks.</AYA>
		<AYA id="038034">And We did try Solomon: We placed on his throne a body; but he did turn (to Us in true devotion):</AYA>
		<AYA id="038035">He said, "O my Lord! Forgive me, and grant me a kingdom which will not belong to another after me: for Thou art the Grantor of Bounties (without measure).</AYA>
		<AYA id="038036">Then We subjected the wind to his power, to flow gently to his order, whithersoever he willed,-</AYA>
		<AYA id="038037">As also the Satans, (including) every kind of builder and diver,-</AYA>
		<AYA id="038038">As also others bound together in fetters.</AYA>
		<AYA id="038039">"Such are Our Bounties: whether thou bestow them (on others) or withhold them, no account will be asked."</AYA>
		<AYA id="038040">And he enjoyed, indeed, a Near Approach to Us, and a beautiful Place of (final) Return.</AYA>
		<AYA id="038041">Commemorate Our Servant Job. Behold he cried to his Lord: "The Satan has afflicted me with distress and suffering!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="038042">"Strike with thy foot: here is (water) wherein to wash, cool and refreshing, and (water) to drink."</AYA>
		<AYA id="038043">And We gave him (back) his people, and doubled their number,- as a Grace from Us, and a thing for commemoration, for all who have Understanding.</AYA>
		<AYA id="038044">"And take in thy hand a little grass, and strike therewith: and break not (thy oath)." Truly We found him full of patience and constancy. How excellent is the servant! Ever did he turn (to Us)!</AYA>
		<AYA id="038045">And commemorate Our Servants Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, possessors of Power and Vision.</AYA>
		<AYA id="038046">Verily We did choose them for a special (purpose)- the remembrance of the Hereafter.</AYA>
		<AYA id="038047">They were, in Our sight, truly, of the company of the Elect and the Good.</AYA>
		<AYA id="038048">And commemorate Ismail, Elisha, and Zulkifl: each of them was of the company of the Good.</AYA>
		<AYA id="038049">This is a Message (of admonition): and verily, for the righteous, is a beautiful place of (final) Return,-</AYA>

		<AYA id="038058">And other Penalties of a similar kind, to match them!</AYA>
		<AYA id="038059">Here is a troop rushing headlong with you! No welcome for them! Truly, they shall burn in the Fire!</AYA>
		<AYA id="038060">(The followers shall cry to the misleaders:) "Nay, ye (too)! No welcome for you! It is ye who have brought this upon us! Now evil is (this) place to stay in!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="038061">They will say: "Our Lord! Whoever brought this upon us,- Add to him a double chastisement in the Fire!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="038062">And they will say: "How is it with us that we see not men whom we used to number among the bad ones?</AYA>
		<AYA id="038063">"Did we treat them (as such) in ridicule, or have (our) eyes failed to perceive them?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="038064">That is true,- the mutual recriminations of the People of the Fire!</AYA>

	<SOURA id="39" name="The Companies">
		<AYA id="039001">The revelation of this Book is from Allah, the Exalted in Power, full of Wisdom.</AYA>
		<AYA id="039002">Verily it is We Who have revealed the Book to thee in Truth: so serve Allah, offering Him sincere devotion.</AYA>
		<AYA id="039003">Is it not to Allah that sincere devotion is due? But those who take for protectors other than Allah (say): "We only serve them in order that they may bring us nearer to Allah." Truly Allah will judge between them in that wherein they differ. But Allah guides not such as are false and ungrateful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="039004">Had Allah wished to take to Himself a son, He could have chosen whom He pleased out of those whom He doth create: but Glory be to Him! (He is above such things.) He is Allah, the One, the Over powering.</AYA>
		<AYA id="039005">He created the heavens and the earth in true (proportions): He makes the Night overlap the Day, and the Day overlap the Night: He has subjected the sun and the moon (to His law): each one follows a course for a time appointed. Is not He the Exalted in Power - He Who forgives again and again?</AYA>
		<AYA id="039006">He created you (all) from a single person: then created, of like nature, his mate; and He sent down for you eight head of cattle in pairs: He creates you, in the wombs of your mothers, in stages, one after another, in three veils of darkness. Such is Allah, your Lord and Cherisher: to Him belongs (all) dominion. There is no god but He: then how are ye turned away (from your true Lord)?</AYA>
		<AYA id="039007">If ye reject (Allah), Truly Allah hath no need of you; but He liketh not ingratitude from His servants: if ye are grateful, He is pleased with you. No bearer of burdens can bear the burden of another. In the end, to your Lord is your Return, when He will tell you the truth of all that ye did (in this life). for He knoweth well all that is in (men's) hearts.</AYA>
		<AYA id="039008">When some trouble toucheth man, he crieth unto his Lord, turning to Him in repentance: but when He bestoweth a favor upon him as from Himself, (man) doth forget what he cried and prayed for before, and he doth set up rivals unto Allah, thus misleading others from Allah's Path. Say, "Enjoy thy disbelief for a little while: verily thou art (one) of the Companions of the Fire!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="039009">Is one who worships devoutly during the hour of the night prostrating himself or standing (in adoration), who takes heed of the Hereafter, and who places his hope in the Mercy of his Lord - (like one who does not)? Say: "Are those equal, those who know and those who do not know? It is those who are endued with understanding that receive admonition.</AYA>
		<AYA id="039010">Say: "O ye My servants who believe! Fear your Lord, good is (the reward) for those who do good in this world. Spacious is Allah's earth! Those who patiently persevere will truly receive a reward without measure!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="039011">Say: "Verily, I am commanded to serve Allah with sincere devotion;</AYA>
		<AYA id="039012">"And I am commanded to be the first of those who submit to Allah in Islm."</AYA>
		<AYA id="039013">Say: "I would, if I disobeyed my Lord, indeed have fear of the Chastisement of a Mighty Day."</AYA>
		<AYA id="039014">Say: "It is Allah I serve, with my sincere (and exclusive) devotion:</AYA>
		<AYA id="039015">"Serve ye what ye will besides Him." Say: "Truly, those in loss are those who lose their own souls and their people on the Day of Judgment: Ah! That is indeed the (real and) evident Loss!</AYA>
		<AYA id="039016">They shall have Layers of Fire above them, and Layers (of Fire) below them: with this doth Allah warn off His servants: "O My Servants! then fear ye Me!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="039017">Those who eschew Tagut,- and fall not into its worship,- and turn to Allah (in repentance),- for them is Good News: so announce the Good News to My Servants,-</AYA>
		<AYA id="039018">Those who listen to the Word, and follow the best of in it: those are the ones who Allah has guided, and those are the ones endued with understanding.</AYA>
		<AYA id="039019">Is, then, one against whom the decree of Punishment is justly due (equal to one who eschews Evil)? Wouldst thou, then, deliver one (who is) in the Fire?</AYA>
		<AYA id="039020">But it is for those who fear their Lord, that lofty mansions, one above another, have been built: beneath them flow rivers: (such is) the Promise of Allah. never doth Allah fail in (His) promise.</AYA>
		<AYA id="039021">Seest thou not that Allah sends down rain from the sky, and leads it through springs in the earth? Then He causes to grow, therewith, produce of various colors: then it withers; thou wilt see it grow yellow; then He makes it dry up and crumble away. Truly, in this, is a Message of remembrance to men of understanding.</AYA>
		<AYA id="039022">Is one whose heart Allah has opened to Islm, so that he has received Light from Allah, (no better than one hard-hearted)? Woe to those whose hearts are hardened against the remembrance of Allah! they are manifestly wandering (in error)!</AYA>
		<AYA id="039023">Allah has revealed (from time to time) the most beautiful Message in the form of a Book, consistent with itself, (yet) repeating (its teaching in various aspects): the skins of those who fear their Lord tremble thereat; then their skins and their hearts do soften to the remembrance of Allah. Such is the guidance of Allah. He guides therewith whom He pleases, but such as Allah leaves to stray, can have none to guide.</AYA>
		<AYA id="039024">Is, then, one who has to ward off the brunt of the Chastisement on the Day of Judgment (and receive it) on his face, (like one guarded therefrom)? It will be said to the wrong- doers: "Taste ye (the fruits of) what ye earned!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="039025">Those before them (also) rejected (revelation), and so the Punishment came to them from directions they did not perceive.</AYA>
		<AYA id="039026">So Allah gave them a taste of humiliation in the present life, but greater is the punishment of the Hereafter, if they only knew!</AYA>
		<AYA id="039027">We have put forth for men, in this Quran every kind of Parable, in order that they may receive admonition.</AYA>
		<AYA id="039028">(It is) a Quran in Arabic, without any crookedness (therein): in order that they may guard against Evil.</AYA>
		<AYA id="039029">Allah puts forth a Parable - a man belonging to many partners at variance with each other, and a man belonging entirely to one master: are those two equal in comparison? Praise be to Allah. but most of them have no knowledge.</AYA>
		<AYA id="039030">Truly thou wilt die (one day), and truly they (too) will die (one day).</AYA>
		<AYA id="039031">In the end will ye (all) dispute, on the Day of Judgment, in the presence of your Lord.</AYA>
		<AYA id="039032">Who, then, doth more wrong than one who utters a lie concerning Allah, and rejects the Truth when it comes to him! Is there not in Hell an abode for the unbelievers?</AYA>
		<AYA id="039033">And he who brings the Truth and he who confirms (and supports) it - such are the men who do right.</AYA>
		<AYA id="039034">They shall have all that they wish for, with their Lord: such is the reward of those who do good:</AYA>
		<AYA id="039035">So that Allah will remit from them (even) the worst in their deeds and give them their reward according to the best of what they have done.</AYA>
		<AYA id="039036">Is not Allah enough for His Servant? But they try to frighten thee with other (gods) besides Him! for such as Allah leaves to stray, there can be no guide.</AYA>
		<AYA id="039037">And such as Allah doth guide there can be none to lead astray. Is not Allah Exalted in Power, Lord of Retribution?</AYA>
		<AYA id="039038">If indeed thou ask them who it is that created the heavens and the earth, they would be sure to say, "Allah". Say: "See ye then? the things that ye invoke besides Allah,- can they, if Allah wills some affliction for me, remove His affliction?- Or if He wills some Mercy for me, can they keep back his Mercy?" Say: "Sufficient is Allah for me! In Him trust those who put their trust."</AYA>
		<AYA id="039039">Say: "O my People! Do whatever ye can: I will do (my part): but soon will ye know-</AYA>
		<AYA id="039040">"Who it is to whom comes a chastisement of ignominy, and on whom descends a chastisement that abides."</AYA>
		<AYA id="039041">Verily We have revealed the Book to thee in Truth, for (instructing) mankind. He, then, that receives guidance benefits his own soul: but he that strays injures his own soul. Nor art thou set a custodian over them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="039042">It is Allah that takes the souls (of men) at death; and those that die not (He takes) during their sleep: those on whom He has passed the decree of death, He keeps back (from returning to life), but the rest He sends (to their bodies) for a term appointed. Verily in this are Signs for those who reflect.</AYA>
		<AYA id="039043">What! Do they take for intercessors others besides Allah? Say: "Even if they have no power whatever and no intelligence?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="039044">Say: "To Allah belongs exclusively (the right to grant) intercession: to Him belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth: In the End, it is to Him that ye shall be brought back."</AYA>
		<AYA id="039045">When Allah, alone, is mentioned, the hearts of those who believe not in the Hereafter are filled with disgust; but when (gods) other than He are mentioned, behold, they are filled with joy!</AYA>
		<AYA id="039046">Say: "O Allah. Creator of the heavens and the earth! Knower of all that is hidden and open! It is Thou that wilt judge between Thy Servants in those matters about which they have differed."</AYA>
		<AYA id="039047">Even if the wrong-doers had all that there is on earth, and as much more, (in vain) would they offer it for ransom from the pain of the Chastisement on the Day of Judgment: but something will confront them from Allah, which they could never have counted upon!</AYA>
		<AYA id="039048">For the evils of their Deeds will confront them, and they will be (completely) encircled by that which they used to mock at!</AYA>
		<AYA id="039049">Now, when trouble touches man, he cries to Us: but when We bestow a favor upon him as from Us, he says, "This has been given to me because of a certain knowledge (I have)!" Nay, but this is but a trial, but most of them understand not!</AYA>
		<AYA id="039050">Thus did the (generations) before them say! But all that they did was of no profit to them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="039051">Nay, the evil results of their Deeds overtook them. And the wrong-doers of this (generation)- the evil results of their Deeds will soon overtake them (too), and they will not escape!</AYA>
		<AYA id="039052">Know they not that Allah enlarges the provision or restricts it, for any He pleases? Verily, in this are Signs for those who believe!</AYA>

		<AYA id="039054">"Turn ye to your Lord (in repentance) and submit to Him, before the chastisement comes on you: after that ye shall not be helped.</AYA>

		<AYA id="040002">The revelation of this Book is from Allah, Exalted in Power, Full of Knowledge,-</AYA>
		<AYA id="040003">Who forgiveth sin, accepteth repentance, is severe in punishment, and is All- Bountiful. There is no god but He: to Him is the final goal.</AYA>
		<AYA id="040004">None can dispute about the Signs of Allah but the Unbelievers. Let not, then, their strutting about through the land deceive thee!</AYA>
		<AYA id="040005">But (there were people) before them, who denied (the Signs),- the People of Noah, and the Confederates after them; and every People plotted against their prophet, to seize him, and disputed by means of vanities, therewith to obliterate the Truth; but it was I that seized them! and how (terrible) was My Requital!</AYA>
		<AYA id="040006">Thus was the Word of thy Lord proved true against the Unbelievers; that truly they are Companions of the Fire!</AYA>
		<AYA id="040007">Those who bear the Throne (of Allah), and those around it Sing Glory and Praise to their Lord; believe in Him; and implore Forgiveness for those who believe: "Our Lord! Thy embracest all things, in Mercy and Knowledge. Forgive, then, those who turn in Repentance, and follow Thy Path; and preserve them from the Chastisement of the Blazing Fire!</AYA>
		<AYA id="040008">"And grant, our Lord! that they enter the Gardens of Eternity, which Thou hast promised to them, and to the righteous among their fathers, their wives, and their posterity! For Thou art (He), the Exalted in Might, Full of Wisdom.</AYA>
		<AYA id="040009">"And preserve them from (all) ills; and any whom Thou dost preserve from ills that Day,- on them wilt Thou have bestowed Mercy indeed: and that will be truly the highest Achievement".</AYA>
		<AYA id="040010">The Unbelievers will be addressed: "Greater was the aversion of Allah to you than (is) your aversion to yourselves, seeing that ye were called to the Faith and ye used to refuse."</AYA>
		<AYA id="040011">They will say: "Our Lord! twice hast Thou made us to die, and twice hast Thou given us Life! Now have we recognized our sins: is there any way out (of this)?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="040012">(The answer will be:) "This is because, when Allah was invoked as the Only (object of worship), ye did reject Faith, but when partners were joined to Him, ye believed! the Command is with Allah, Most High, Most Great!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="040013">He it is Who showeth you His Signs, and sendeth down sustenance for you from the sky: but only those receive admonition who turn (to Allah).</AYA>
		<AYA id="040014">Call ye, then, upon Allah with sincere devotion to Him, even though the Unbelievers may detest it.</AYA>
		<AYA id="040015">Exalted is He in His attributes, (He is) the Lord of the Throne: by His Command doth He send the Spirit (of inspiration) to any of His servants He pleases, that it may warn (men) of the Day of Mutual Meeting,-</AYA>
		<AYA id="040016">The Day whereon they will (all) come forth: not a single thing concerning them is hidden from Allah. Whose will be the Dominion that Day?" That of Allah, the One the Over powering!</AYA>
		<AYA id="040017">That Day will every soul be requited for what it earned; no injustice will there be that Day, for Allah is Swift in taking account.</AYA>
		<AYA id="040018">Warn them of the Day that is (ever) drawing near, when the hearts will (come) right up to the throats to choke (them); No intimate friend nor intercessor will the wrong-doers have, who could be listened to.</AYA>
		<AYA id="040019">(Allah) knows the treachery of the eyes, and all that the hearts (of men) conceal.</AYA>
		<AYA id="040020">And Allah will judge with (justice and) Truth: but those whom (men) invoke besides Him, will not (be in a position) to judge at all. Verily it is Allah (alone) Who hears and sees (all things).</AYA>
		<AYA id="040021">Do they not travel through the earth and see what was the End of those before them? They were even superior to them in strength, and in the traces (they have left) in the land: but Allah did call them to account for their sins, and none had they to defend them against Allah.</AYA>
		<AYA id="040022">That was because there came to them their messengers with Clear (Signs), but they rejected them: so Allah called them to account: for He is Full of Strength, Strict in Punishment.</AYA>
		<AYA id="040023">Of old We sent Moses, with Our Signs and an authority manifest,</AYA>
		<AYA id="040024">To Pharaoh, Hmn, and Qrn; but they called (him)" a sorcerer telling lies!"...</AYA>
		<AYA id="040025">Now, when he brought them the Truth, from Us, they said, "Slay the sons of those who believe with him, and keep alive their females," but the plots of Unbelievers (end) in nothing but errors (and delusions)! ...</AYA>
		<AYA id="040026">Said Pharaoh: "Leave me to slay Moses; and let him call on his Lord! What I fear is lest he should change your religion, or lest he should cause mischief to appear in the land!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="040027">Moses said: "I have indeed called upon my Lord and your Lord (for protection) from every arrogant one who believes not in the Day of Account!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="040028">A believer, a man from among the people of Pharaoh, who had concealed his faith, said: "Will ye slay a man because he says, 'My Lord is Allah.?- when he has indeed come to you with Clear (Signs) from your Lord? And if he be a liar, on him is (the sin of) his lie: but, if he is telling the Truth, then will fall on you something of the (calamity) of which he warns you: truly Allah guides not one who transgresses and lies!</AYA>
		<AYA id="040029">"O my People! Yours is the dominion this day: Ye have the upper hand in the land: but who will help us from the Punishment of Allah, should it befall us?" Pharaoh said: "I but point out to you that which I see (myself); Nor do I guide you but to the Path of Right!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="040030">Then said the man who believed: "O my people! Truly I do fear for you something like the Day (of disaster) of the Confederates (in sin)!-</AYA>
		<AYA id="040031">"Something like the fate of the People of Noah, the d, and the Thamd, and those who came after them: but Allah never wishes injustice to His Servants.</AYA>
		<AYA id="040032">"And O my people! I fear for you a Day when there will be Mutual calling (and wailing),-</AYA>
		<AYA id="040033">"A Day when ye shall turn your backs and flee: no defender shall ye have from Allah: any whom Allah leaves to stray, there is none to guide...</AYA>
		<AYA id="040034">"And to you there came Joseph in times gone by, with Clear Signs, but ye ceased not to doubt of the (Mission) for which he had come: at length, when he died, ye said: 'No messenger will Allah send after him.' Thus doth Allah leave to stray such as transgress and live in doubt,-</AYA>
		<AYA id="040035">"(Such) as dispute about the Signs of Allah, without any authority that hath reached them, very hateful (is such conduct) in the sight of Allah and of the Believers. Thus doth Allah seal up every heart - of arrogant tyrinical."</AYA>
		<AYA id="040036">Pharaoh said: "O Hmn! Build me a lofty palace, that I may attain the ways and means-</AYA>
		<AYA id="040037">"The ways and means of (reaching) the heavens, and that I may look up to the God of Moses: but surely, I think (Moses) is a liar!" Thus was made alluring, in Pharaoh's eyes, the evil of his deeds, and he was hindered from the Path; and the plot of Pharaoh led to nothing but perdition (for him).</AYA>
		<AYA id="040038">The man who believed said further: "O my people! Follow me: I will lead you to the Path of Right.</AYA>
		<AYA id="040039">"O my people! This life of the present is nothing but (temporary) enjoyment: it is the Hereafter that is the Home that will last.</AYA>
		<AYA id="040040">"He that works evil will not be requited but by the like thereof: and he that works a righteous deed - whether man or woman - and is a Believer- such will enter the Garden (of Bliss): therein will they have abundance without measure.</AYA>
		<AYA id="040041">"And O my people! How (strange) it is for me to call you to Salvation while ye call me to the Fire!</AYA>
		<AYA id="040042">"Ye do call upon me to blaspheme against Allah, and to join with Him partners of whom I have no knowledge; and I call you to the Exalted in Power, Who forgives again and again!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="040043">"Without doubt ye do call me to one who has no claim be called to, whether in this world, or in the Hereafter; our return will be to Allah: and the Transgressors will be Companions of the Fire!</AYA>
		<AYA id="040044">"Soon will ye remember what I say to you (now), My (own) affair I commit to Allah: for Allah (ever) watches over His Servants."</AYA>
		<AYA id="040045">Then Allah saved him from (every) evil that they plotted (against him), but the burnt of the Chastisement encompassed on all sides the People of Pharaoh.</AYA>
		<AYA id="040046">In front of the Fire will they be brought, morning and evening: and (the sentence will be) on the Day when the Hour comes to pass: "Cast ye the People of Pharaoh into the severest Penalty!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="040047">Behold, they will dispute with each other in the Fire! The weak ones (who followed) will say to those who had been arrogant, "We but followed you: can ye then take (on yourselves) from us some share of the Fire?</AYA>
		<AYA id="040048">Those who had been arrogant will say: "We are all in this (Fire)! Truly, Allah has judged between (His) Servants!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="040049">Those in the Fire will say to the Keepers of Hell: "Pray to your Lord to lighten us the Chastisement for a day (at least)!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="040050">They will say: "Did there not come to you your messengers with Clear Signs?" They will say, "Yes". They will reply, "Then pray (as ye like)! But the prayer of those without Faith is nothing but (futile wandering) in (mazes of) error!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="040051">We will, without doubt, help Our messengers and those who believe, (both) in this world's life and on the Day when the Witnesses will stand forth,-</AYA>
		<AYA id="040052">The Day when no profit will it be to Wrong-doers to present their excuses, but they will (only) have the Curse and the Home of Misery.</AYA>
		<AYA id="040053">We did aforetime give Moses the Guidance, and We gave the Book in inheritance to the Children of Israel,-</AYA>
		<AYA id="040054">A Guide and a Reminder to men of understanding.</AYA>
		<AYA id="040055">Patiently, then, persevere: for the Promise of Allah is true: and ask forgiveness for thy fault, and celebrate the Praises of thy Lord in the evening and in the morning.</AYA>
		<AYA id="040056">Those who dispute about the Signs of Allah without any authority bestowed on them,- there is nothing in their breasts but (the quest of) greatness, which they shall never attain to: seek refuge, then, in Allah: it is He Who hears and sees (all things).</AYA>
		<AYA id="040057">Assuredly the creation of the heavens and the earth is a greater (matter) than the creation of men: Yet most men know not.</AYA>
		<AYA id="040058">Not equal are the blind and those who (clearly) see: nor are (equal) those who believe and work deeds of righteousness, and those who do evil. Little do ye learn by admonition!</AYA>
		<AYA id="040059">The Hour will certainly come: therein is no doubt: yet most men believe not.</AYA>
		<AYA id="040060">And your Lord says: "Call on Me; I will answer your (prayer): but those who are too arrogant to serve Me will surely enter Hell abased!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="040061">It is Allah Who has made the Night for you, that ye may rest therein, and the Day to give you light. Verily Allah is full of Grace and Bounty to men: yet most men give no thanks.</AYA>
		<AYA id="040062">Such is Allah, your Lord, the Creator of all things, there is no god but He: then how ye are deluded away from the Truth!</AYA>
		<AYA id="040063">Thus are deluded those who are wont to reject the Signs of Allah.</AYA>
		<AYA id="040064">It is Allah Who has made for you the earth as a resting place, and the sky as a canopy, and has given you shape- and made your shapes beautiful,- and has provided for you Sustenance, of things pure and good;- such is Allah your Lord. So Glory to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds!</AYA>
		<AYA id="040065">He is the Living (One): There is no god but He. Call upon Him, giving Him sincere devotion. Praise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds!</AYA>
		<AYA id="040066">Say: "I have been forbidden to invoke those whom ye invoke besides Allah,- seeing that the Clear Sings have come to me from my Lord; and I have been commanded to bow (in Islm) to the Lord of the Worlds."</AYA>
		<AYA id="040067">It is He Who has created you from dust then from a sperm-drop, then from a leech-like clot; then does He get you out (into the light) as a child: then lets you (grow and) reach your age of full strength; then lets you become old,- though of you there are some who die before;- and lets you reach a Term appointed; in order that ye may understand.</AYA>
		<AYA id="040068">It is He Who gives Life and Death; and when He decides upon an affair, He says to it, "Be", and it is.</AYA>
		<AYA id="040069">Seest thou not those that dispute concerning the Sings of Allah? How are they turned away (from Reality)?-</AYA>
		<AYA id="040070">Those who reject the Book and the (revelations) with which We sent Our messengers: but soon shall they know,-</AYA>
		<AYA id="040071">When the yokes (shall be) round their necks, and the chains; they shall be dragged along-</AYA>
		<AYA id="040072">In the boiling fetid fluid: then in the Fire shall they be burned;</AYA>
		<AYA id="040073">Then shall it be said to them: "Where are the (deities) to which ye gave part - worship-</AYA>
		<AYA id="040074">"Besides Allah?" They will reply: "They have left us in the lurch: Nay, we invoked not, of old, anything (that had real existence)." Thus does Allah leave the Unbelievers to stray.</AYA>
		<AYA id="040075">"That was because ye were wont to rejoice on the earth in things other than the Truth, and that ye were wont to be insolent.</AYA>
		<AYA id="040076">"Enter ye the gates of Hell, to dwell therein: and evil is (this) abode of the arrogant!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="040077">So persevere in patience; for the Promise of Allah is true: and whether We show thee (in this life) some part of what We promise them,- or We take thy soul (to Our Mercy) (before that),-(in any case) it is to Us that they shall (all) return.</AYA>
		<AYA id="040078">We did aforetime send messengers before thee: of them there are some whose story We have related to thee, and some whose story We have not related to thee. It was not (possible) for any messenger to bring a sign except by the leave of Allah: but when the Command of Allah issued, the matter was decided in truth and justice, and there perished, there and then, those who stood on Falsehoods.</AYA>
		<AYA id="040079">It is Allah Who made cattle for you, that ye may use some for riding and some for food;</AYA>
		<AYA id="040080">And there are (other) advantages in them for you (besides); that ye may through them attain to any need (there may be) in your hearts; and on them and on ships ye are carried.</AYA>
		<AYA id="040081">And He shows you (always) His Signs: then which of the Signs of Allah will ye deny?</AYA>
		<AYA id="040082">Do they not travel through the earth and see what was the End of those before them? They were more numerous than these and superior in strength and in the traces (they have left) in the land: Yet all that they accomplished was of no profit to them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="040083">For when their messengers came to them with Clear Signs, they exulted in such knowledge (and skill) as they had; but that very (Wrath) at which they were wont to scoff hemmed them in.</AYA>
		<AYA id="040084">But when they saw Our Might, they said: "We believe in Allah,- the One God - and we reject the partners we used to join with Him!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="040085">But their professing the Faith when they (actually) saw Our Punishment was not going to profit them. (Such has been) Allah's Way of dealing with His Servants (from the most ancient times). And even thus did the Rejecters of Allah perish (utterly)!</AYA>

		<AYA id="041002">A revelation from the Most Gracious, Most Merciful;-</AYA>
		<AYA id="041003">A Book, whereof the verses are explained in detail;- a Quran in Arabic, for people who understand;-</AYA>
		<AYA id="041004">Giving good news and admonition: yet most of them turn away, and so they hear not.</AYA>
		<AYA id="041005">They say: "Our hearts are under veils, (concealed) from that to which thou dost invite us, and in our ears in a deafness, and between us and thee is a screen: so do thou (what thou wilt); for us, we shall do (what we will!)"</AYA>
		<AYA id="041006">Say thou: "I am but a man like you: it is revealed to me by inspiration, that your God is One God. so take the straight path unto Him, and ask for His Forgiveness." And woe to those who join gods with Allah,-</AYA>
		<AYA id="041007">Those who pay Zakat, and who even deny the Hereafter.</AYA>
		<AYA id="041008">For those who believe and work deeds of righteousness is a reward that will never fail.</AYA>
		<AYA id="041009">Say: Is it that ye deny Him Who created the earth in two Days? And do ye join equals with Him? He is the Lord of (all) the Worlds.</AYA>
		<AYA id="041010">He set on the (earth), mountains standing firm, high above it, and bestowed blessings on the earth, and measure therein its sustenance, in four Days, alike for (all) who ask.</AYA>
		<AYA id="041011">Then He turned to the sky, and it had been (as) smoke: He said to it and to the earth: "Come ye together, willingly or unwillingly." They said: "We do come (together), in willing obedience."</AYA>
		<AYA id="041012">So He completed them as seven firmaments in two Days, and He assigned to each heaven its duty and command. And We adorned the lower heaven with lights, and (provided it) with guard. Such is the Decree of (Him) the Exalted in Might, Full of Knowledge.</AYA>
		<AYA id="041013">But if they turn away, say thou: "I have warned you of a thunderbolt like the thunderbolt of the d and the Thamd!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="041014">Behold, the messengers came to them, from before them and behind them, (preaching): "Serve none but Allah." They said, "If our Lord had so pleased, He would certainly have sent down angels. So we disbelieve in the message you were sent with."</AYA>
		<AYA id="041015">Now the d behaved arrogantly through the land, against (all) truth and reason, and said: "Who is superior to us in strength?" What! Did they not see that Allah, Who created them, was superior to them in strength? But they continued to reject Our Signs!</AYA>
		<AYA id="041016">So We sent against them a furious Wind through days of disaster, that We might give them a taste of a chastisement of humiliation in this life; but the Penalty of a Hereafter will be more humiliating still: and they will find no help.</AYA>
		<AYA id="041017">As to the Thamd, We gave them Guidance, but they preferred blindness (of heart) to Guidance: so the thunderbolt of the Chastisement of humiliation seized them, because of what they had earned.</AYA>
		<AYA id="041018">But We delivered those who believed and practiced righteousness.</AYA>
		<AYA id="041019">The Day that the enemies of Allah will be gathered together to the Fire, they will be marched in ranks.</AYA>
		<AYA id="041020">At length, when they reach the (Fire), their hearing, their sight, and their skins will bear witness against them, as to (all) their deeds.</AYA>
		<AYA id="041021">They will say to their skins: "Why bear ye witness against us?" They will say: "Allah hath given us speech,- (He) Who giveth speech to everything: He created you for the first time, and unto Him were ye to return.</AYA>
		<AYA id="041022">"Ye did not seek to hide yourselves, lest your hearing, your sight, and your skins should bear witness against you! But ye did think that Allah knew not many of the things that ye used to do!</AYA>
		<AYA id="041023">"But this thought of yours which ye did entertain concerning your Lord, hath brought you to destruction, and (now) have ye become of those utterly lost!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="041024">If, then, they have patience, the Fire will be a home for them! and if they beg for pardon, their suit shall not be granted.</AYA>
		<AYA id="041025">And We have destined for them intimate companions (of like nature), who made alluring to them what was before them and behind them; and the sentence among the previous generations of Jinns and men, who have passed away, is proved against them; for they are utterly lost.</AYA>
		<AYA id="041026">The Unbelievers say: "Listen not to this Quran, but talk at random in the midst of its (reading), that ye may gain the upper hand!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="041027">But We will certainly give the Unbelievers a taste of a severe chastisement, and We will requite them for the worst of their deeds.</AYA>
		<AYA id="041028">Such is the requital of the enemies of Allah,- the Fire: therein will be for them the Eternal Home: a (fit) requital, for that they were wont to reject Our Sings.</AYA>
		<AYA id="041029">And the Unbelievers will say: "Our Lord! Show us those, among Jinns and men, who misled us: we shall crush them beneath our feet, so that they become the vilest."</AYA>
		<AYA id="041030">In the case of those who say, "Our Lord is Allah", and, further, stand straight and steadfast, the angels descend on them (from time to time): "Fear ye not!" (they suggest), "Nor grieve! but receive the Glad Tidings of the Garden (of Bliss), the which ye were promised!</AYA>
		<AYA id="041031">"We are your protectors in this life and in the Hereafter: therein shall ye have all that you shall desire; therein shall ye have all that ye ask for!-</AYA>
		<AYA id="041032">"A hospitable gift from One Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="041033">Who is better in speech than one who calls (men) to Allah, works righteousness, and says, "I am of those who bow in Islm"?</AYA>
		<AYA id="041034">Nor can Goodness and Evil be equal. Repel (Evil) with what is better: then will he between whom and thee was hatred become as it were thy friend and intimate!</AYA>
		<AYA id="041035">And no one will be granted such goodness except those who exercise patience and self-restraint,- none but persons of the greatest good fortune.</AYA>
		<AYA id="041036">And if (at any time) an incitement to discord is made to thee by the Satan, seek refuge in Allah. He is the One Who hears and knows all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="041037">Among His Sings are the Night and the Day, and the Sun and the Moon. prostrate not to the Sun and the Moon, but prostrate to Allah, Who created them, if it is Him ye wish to serve.</AYA>
		<AYA id="041038">But is the (Unbelievers) are arrogant, (no matter): for in the presence of thy Lord are those who celebrate His praises by night and by day. And they never flag (nor feel themselves above it).</AYA>
		<AYA id="041039">And among His Signs in this: thou seest the earth humble; but when We send down rain to it, it is stirred to life and yields increase. Truly, He Who gives life to the (dead) earth can surely give life to (men) who are dead. For He has power over all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="041040">Those who pervert the Truth in Our Signs are not hidden from Us. Which is better?- he that is cast into the Fire, or he that comes safe through, on the Day of Judgment? Do what ye will: verily He seeth (clearly) all that ye do.</AYA>
		<AYA id="041041">Those who reject the Message when it comes to them (are not hidden from Us). And indeed it is a Book of exalted power.</AYA>
		<AYA id="041042">No falsehood can approach it from before or behind it: it is sent down by One Full of Wisdom, Worthy of all Praise.</AYA>
		<AYA id="041043">Nothing is said to thee that was not said to the messengers before thee: surely thy lord has at His Command (all) Forgiveness as well as a most Grievous Chastisement.</AYA>
		<AYA id="041044">Had We sent this as a Quran (in the language) other than Arabic, they would have said: "Why are not its verses explained in detail? What! a foreign (tongue) and (a Messenger) an Arab?" Say: "It is a Guide and a Healing to those who believe; and for those who believe not, there is a deafness in their ears, and it is blindness in their (eyes): they are (as it were) being called from a place far distant!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="041045">We certainly gave Moses the Book aforetime: but disputes arose therein. Had it not been for a Word that went forth before from thy Lord, (their differences) would have been settled between them: but they remained in suspicious disquieting doubt thereon.</AYA>
		<AYA id="041046">Whoever works righteousness benefits his own soul; whoever works evil, it is against his own soul: nor is thy Lord ever unjust (in the least) to His servants.</AYA>
		<AYA id="041047">To Him is referred the Knowledge of the Hour (of Judgment: He knows all): No fruit comes out of its sheath, nor does a female conceive (within her womb) nor bring forth (young), but by His knowledge. The Day that (Allah) will propound to them the (question), "Where are the partners (ye attributed) to Me?" They will say, "We do assure Thee not one of us can bear witness!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="041048">The (deities) they used to invoke aforetime will leave them in the lurch, and they will perceive that they have no way of escape.</AYA>
		<AYA id="041049">Man does not weary of asking for good (things), but if ill touches him, he gives up all hope (and) is lost in despair.</AYA>
		<AYA id="041050">When We give him a taste of some Mercy from Us, after some adversity has touched him, he is sure to say, "This is due to my (merit): I think not that the Hour (of Judgment) will (ever) be established; but if I am brought back to my Lord, I have (much) good (stored) in His sight!" But We will show the Unbelievers the truth of all that they did, and We shall give them the taste of a severe chastisement.</AYA>
		<AYA id="041051">When We bestow favors on man, he turns away, and gets himself remote on his side (instead of coming to Us); and when evil seizes him, (he comes) full of prolonged prayer!</AYA>
		<AYA id="041052">Say: "See ye if the (Revelation) is (really) from Allah, and yet do ye reject it? Who is more astray than one who is in a schism far (from any purpose)?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="041053">Soon will We show them Our Signs in the (furthest) regions (of the earth), and in their own souls, until it becomes manifest to them that this is the Truth. Is it not enough that thy Lord doth witness all things?</AYA>
		<AYA id="041054">Ah indeed! Are they in doubt concerning the Meeting with their Lord? Ah indeed! It is He that doth encompass all things!</AYA>

		<AYA id="042001">H Mm</AYA>
		<AYA id="042002">in. Sn. Qf.</AYA>
		<AYA id="042003">Thus doth (He) send inspiration to thee as (He did) to those before thee,- Allah, Exalted in Power, Full of Wisdom.</AYA>
		<AYA id="042004">To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and on earth: and He is Most High, Most Great.</AYA>
		<AYA id="042005">The heavens are almost rent asunder from above them (by His Glory): and the angels celebrate the Praises of their Lord, and pray for forgiveness for (all) beings on earth: Behold! Verily Allah is He, the Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="042006">And those who take as protectors others besides Him,- Allah doth watch over them; and thou art not the disposer of their affairs.</AYA>
		<AYA id="042007">Thus have We sent by inspiration to thee an Arabic Quran: that thou mayest warn the Mother of Cities and all around her,- and warn (them) of the Day of Assembly, of which there is no doubt: (when) some will be in the Garden, and some in the Blazing Fire.</AYA>
		<AYA id="042008">If Allah had so willed, He could have made them a single people; but He admits whom He will to His Mercy; and the Wrong-doers will have no protector nor helper.</AYA>
		<AYA id="042009">What! Have they taken (for worship) protectors besides Him? But it is Allah,- He is the Protector, and it is He Who gives life to the dead: it is He Who has power over all things,</AYA>
		<AYA id="042010">Whatever it be wherein ye differ, the decision thereof is with Allah. such is Allah my Lord: in Him I trust, and to Him I turn.</AYA>
		<AYA id="042011">(He is) the Creator of the heavens and the earth: He has made for you pairs from among yourselves, and pairs among cattle: by this means does He multiply you: there is nothing whatever like unto Him, and He is the One that hears and sees.</AYA>
		<AYA id="042012">To Him belong the keys of the heavens and the earth: He enlarges and restricts. The Sustenance to whom He will: for He knows full well all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="042013">The same religion has He established for you as that which He enjoined on Noah - the which We have sent by inspiration to thee - and that which We enjoined on Abraham, Moses, and Jesus: Namely, that ye should remain steadfast in religion, and make no divisions therein: to those who worship other things than Allah, hard is the (way) to which thou callest them. Allah chooses to Himself those whom He pleases, and guides to Himself those who turn (to Him).</AYA>
		<AYA id="042014">And they became divided only after Knowledge reached them,- being insolent to one another. Had it not been for a Word that went forth before from thy Lord, (tending) to a Term appointed, the matter would have been settled between them: but truly those who have inherited the Book after them are in suspicious (disquieting) doubt concerning it.</AYA>
		<AYA id="042015">Now then, for that (reason), call (them to the Faith), and stand steadfast as thou art commanded, nor follow thou their vain desires; but say: "I believe in whatever Book Allah has sent down; and I am commanded to judge justly between you. Allah is our Lord and your Lord: for us (is the responsibility for) our deeds, and for you for your deeds. There is no contention between us and you. Allah will bring us together, and to Him is (our) final goal.</AYA>
		<AYA id="042016">But those who dispute concerning Allah after He has been accepted,- futile is their argument in the sight of their Lord: on them is Wrath, and for them will beach Terrible.</AYA>
		<AYA id="042017">It is Allah Who has sent down the Book in Truth, and the Balance, and what will make thee realize that perhaps the Hour is close at hand?</AYA>
		<AYA id="042018">Only those wish to hasten it who believe not in it: those who believe hold it in awe, and know that it is the Truth. Behold, verily those that dispute concerning the Hour are far astray.</AYA>
		<AYA id="042019">Gracious is Allah to His servants: He gives Sustenance to whom He pleases: and He is the Strong, the Mighty.</AYA>
		<AYA id="042020">To any that desires the tilth of the Hereafter, We give increase in his tilth, and to any that desires the tilth of this world, We grant somewhat thereof, but he has no share or lot in the Hereafter.</AYA>
		<AYA id="042021">What! Have they partners (in godhead), who have established for them some religion without the permission of Allah? Had it not been for the Decree of Judgment, the matter would have been decided between them (at once). But verily the Wrong- doers will have a grievous chastisement.</AYA>
		<AYA id="042022">Thou wilt see the Wrong-doers in fear on account of what they have earned, and (the burden of) that must (necessarily) fall on them. But those who believe and work righteous deeds will be in the Meadows of the Gardens: they shall have, before their Lord, all that they wish for. That will indeed be the magnificent Bounty (of Allah).</AYA>
		<AYA id="042023">That is (the Bounty) whereof Allah gives Glad Tidings to His Servants who believe and do righteous deeds. Say: "No reward do I ask of you for this except the love of those near of kin." And if any one earns any good, We shall give him an increase of good in respect thereof: for Allah is Oft- Forgiving, Grateful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="042024">What! Do they say, "He has forged a falsehood against Allah."? But if Allah willed, He could seal up thy heart. And Allah blots out Falsehood, and proves the Truth by His Words. For He knows well the secrets of all hearts.</AYA>
		<AYA id="042025">He is the One that accepts repentance from His servants and forgives sins: and He knows all that ye do.</AYA>
		<AYA id="042026">And He listens to those who believe and do deeds of righteousness, and gives them increase of His Bounty: but for the Unbelievers their is a terrible chastisement.</AYA>
		<AYA id="042027">If Allah were to enlarge the provision for His servants, they would indeed transgress beyond all bounds through the earth; but He sends (it) down in due measure as He pleases. For He is with His servants Well-acquainted, Watchful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="042028">He is the One that sends down rain (even) after (men) have given up all hope, and scatters His Mercy (far and wide). And He is the Protector, Worthy of all Praise.</AYA>
		<AYA id="042029">And among His Signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the living creatures that He has scattered through them: and He has power to gather them together when He wills.</AYA>
		<AYA id="042030">Whatever misfortune happens to you, is because of the things your hands have wrought, and for many (a sin) He grants forgiveness.</AYA>
		<AYA id="042031">Nor can ye escape through the earth; nor have ye, besides Allah, any one to protect or to help.</AYA>
		<AYA id="042032">And among His Signs are the ships, smooth-running through the ocean, (tall) as mountains.</AYA>
		<AYA id="042033">If it be His Will, He can still the Wind: then would they become motionless on the back of the (ocean). Verily in this are Signs for everyone who patiently perseveres and is grateful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="042034">Or He can cause them to perish because of the (evil) which (the men) have earned; but much doth He forgive.</AYA>
		<AYA id="042035">But let those know, who dispute about Our Signs, that there is for them no way of escape.</AYA>
		<AYA id="042036">Whatever ye are given (here) is (but) the enjoyment of this life: but that which is with Allah is better and mo f33 re lasting: (it is) for those who believe and put their trust in their Lord:</AYA>
		<AYA id="042037">Those who avoid the greater sins and indecencies, and, when they are angry even then forgive;</AYA>
		<AYA id="042038">Those who respond to their Lord, and establish regular prayer; who (conduct) their affairs by mutual Consultation; who spend out of what We bestow on them for Sustenance;</AYA>
		<AYA id="042039">And those who, when an oppressive wrong is inflicted on them, (are not cowed but) help and defend themselves.</AYA>
		<AYA id="042040">The recompense for an injury is an injury equal thereto (in degree): but if a person forgives and makes reconciliation, his reward is due from Allah: for (Allah) loveth not those who do wrong.</AYA>
		<AYA id="042041">But indeed if any do help and defend himself after a wrong (done) to him, against such there is no cause of blame.</AYA>
		<AYA id="042042">The blame is only against those who oppress men with wrong-doing and insolently transgress beyond bounds through the land, defying right and justice: for such there will be a chastisement grievous.</AYA>
		<AYA id="042043">But indeed if any show patience and forgive, that would truly be an affair of great resolution.</AYA>
		<AYA id="042044">For any whom Allah leaves astray, there is no protector thereafter. And thou wilt see the Wrong-doers, when in sight of the Chastisement, Say: "Is there any way (to effect) a return?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="042045">And thou wilt see them brought forward to the (Penalty), abject in humbleness, (and) looking with a stealthy glance. And the Believers will say: "Those are indeed in loss, who lose themselves and their families on the Day of Judgment. Behold! Truly the Wrong-doers are in a lasting Chastisement!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="042046">And no protectors have they to help them, other than Allah. And for any whom Allah leaves to stray, there is no way (to the Goal).</AYA>
		<AYA id="042047">Respond ye to your Lord, before there come a Day which there will be no putting back, because of (the Ordainment of) Allah! That Day there will be for you no place of refuge nor will there be for you any room for denial (of your sins)!</AYA>
		<AYA id="042048">If then they run away, We have not sent thee as a guard over them. Thy duty is but to convey (the Message). And truly, when We give man a taste of a Mercy from Us, he doth exult thereat, but when some ill happens to him, on account of the deeds which his hands have sent forth, truly then is man ungrateful!</AYA>
		<AYA id="042049">To Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. He creates what He wills. He bestows (children) male or female according to His Will,</AYA>
		<AYA id="042050">Or He bestows both males and females, and He leaves barren whom He will: for He is full of Knowledge and Power.</AYA>
		<AYA id="042051">It is not fitting for a man that Allah should speak to him except by inspiration, or from behind a veil, or by the sending of a messenger to reveal, with Allah's permission, what Allah wills: for He is Most High, Most Wise.</AYA>
		<AYA id="042052">And thus have We, by Our Command, sent inspiration to thee: thou knewest not (before) what was Revelation, and what was Faith; but We have made the (Qurn) a Light, wherewith We guide such of Our servants as We will; and verily thou dost guide (men) to the Straight Way,-</AYA>
		<AYA id="042053">The Way of Allah, to Whom belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on earth. Behold (how) all affairs tend towards Allah!</AYA>

		<AYA id="043002">By the Book that makes things clear,-</AYA>
		<AYA id="043003">We have made it a Quran in Arabic, that ye may be able to understand.</AYA>
		<AYA id="043004">And verily, it is in the Mother of the Book, with Us, high (in dignity), full of wisdom.</AYA>
		<AYA id="043005">Shall We then turn away the Reminder from you altogether, for that ye are a people transgressing beyond bounds?</AYA>
		<AYA id="043006">But how many were the prophets We sent amongst the peoples of old?</AYA>
		<AYA id="043007">And never came there a prophet to them but they mocked him.</AYA>
		<AYA id="043008">So We destroyed (men)- stronger in power than these;- and (thus) has passed on the Example of the peoples of old.</AYA>
		<AYA id="043009">If thou wert to question them, 'Who created the heavens and the earth?' They would be sure to reply, 'They were created by (Him), the Exalted in Power, Full of Knowledge';-</AYA>
		<AYA id="043010">(Yea, the same that) has made for you the earth spread out, and has made for you roads (and channels) therein, in order that ye may find guidance (on the way);</AYA>
		<AYA id="043011">That sends down (from time to time) rain from the sky in due measure;- and We raise to life therewith a land that is dead; even so will ye be raised (from the dead);-</AYA>
		<AYA id="043012">That has created pairs in all things, and has made for you ships and cattle on which ye ride,</AYA>
		<AYA id="043013">In order that ye may sit firm and square on their backs, and when so seated, ye may remember the (kind) favor of your Lord, and say, "Glory to Him Who has subjected these to our (use), for we could never be able to do it,</AYA>
		<AYA id="043014">"And to our Lord, surely, must we turn back!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="043015">Yet they attribute to some of His servants a share with Him! Truly is man a clearly unthankful!</AYA>
		<AYA id="043016">What! Has He taken daughters out of what He Himself creates, and granted to you sons for choice?</AYA>
		<AYA id="043017">When news is brought to one of them of (the birth of) what he sets up as a likeness to (Allah) Most Gracious, his face darkens, and he is filled with inward grief!</AYA>
		<AYA id="043018">Is then one brought up among trinkets, and unable to give a clear account in a dispute (to be associated with Allah)?</AYA>
		<AYA id="043019">And they make into females angels who themselves serve Allah. Did they witness their creation? Their evidence will be recorded, and they will be called to account!</AYA>
		<AYA id="043020">("Ah!") they say, "If it had been the will of the Most Gracious, we should not have worshipped such (deities)!" Of that they have no knowledge! They do nothing but lie!</AYA>
		<AYA id="043021">What! have We given them a Book before this, to which they are holding fast?</AYA>
		<AYA id="043022">Nay! they say: "We found our fathers following a certain religion, and we do guide ourselves by their footsteps."</AYA>
		<AYA id="043023">Just in the same way, whenever We sent a Warner before thee to any people, the wealthy ones among them said: "We found our fathers following a certain religion, and we will certainly follow in their footsteps."</AYA>
		<AYA id="043024">He said: "What! Even if I brought you better guidance than that which ye found your fathers following?" They said: "For us, we deny that ye (prophets) are sent (with)."</AYA>
		<AYA id="043025">So We exacted retribution from them: now see what was the end of those who rejected (Truth)!</AYA>
		<AYA id="043026">Behold! Abraham said to his father and his people: "I do indeed clear myself of what ye worship:</AYA>
		<AYA id="043027">"(I worship) only Him Who originated me, and He will certainly guide me."</AYA>
		<AYA id="043028">And he left it as a Word to endure among those who came after him, that they may turn back (to Allah).</AYA>
		<AYA id="043029">Yea, I have given the good things of this life to these (men) and their fathers, until the Truth has come to them, and a messenger making things clear.</AYA>
		<AYA id="043030">But when the Truth came to them, they said: "This is sorcery, and we do reject it."</AYA>
		<AYA id="043031">Also, they say: "Why is not this Quran sent down to some leading man in either of the two (chief) cities?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="043032">Is it they who would portion out the Mercy of thy Lord? It is We Who portion out between them their livelihood in the life of this world: and We raise some of them above others in ranks, so that some may command work from others. But the Mercy of thy Lord is better than the (wealth) which they amass.</AYA>
		<AYA id="043033">And were it not that (all) men might become of one community, We would provide, for everyone that blasphemes against the Most Gracious, silver roofs for their houses and (silver) stair-ways on which to go up,</AYA>
		<AYA id="043034">And (silver) doors to their houses, and couches (of silver) on which they could recline,</AYA>
		<AYA id="043035">And also adornments of gold. But all this were nothing but enjoyment of the present life: the Hereafter, in the sight of thy Lord, is for the Righteous.</AYA>
		<AYA id="043036">If anyone withdraws himself from remembrance of the Most Gracious, We appoint for him a Satan, to be an intimate companion to him.</AYA>
		<AYA id="043037">Such (Satans) really hinder them from the Path, but they think that they are being guided aright!</AYA>
		<AYA id="043038">At length, when (such a one) comes to Us, he says (to his evil companion): "Would that between me and thee were the distance of East and West!" Ah! evil is the companion (indeed)!</AYA>
		<AYA id="043039">When ye have done wrong, it will avail you nothing, that Day, that ye shall be partners in Punishment!</AYA>
		<AYA id="043040">Canst thou then make the deaf to hear, or give direction to the blind or to such as (wander) in manifest error?</AYA>
		<AYA id="043041">Even if We take thee away, We shall be sure to exact retribution from them,</AYA>
		<AYA id="043042">Or We shall show thee that (accomplished) which We have promised them: for verily We have power over them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="043043">So hold thou fast to the Revelation sent down to thee; verily thou art on a Straight Way.</AYA>
		<AYA id="043044">The (Qurn) is indeed a reminder, for thee and for thy people; and soon shall ye (all) be brought to account.</AYA>
		<AYA id="043045">And question thou our messengers whom We sent before thee; did We appoint any deities other than the Most Gracious, to be worshipped?</AYA>
		<AYA id="043046">We did send Moses aforetime, with Our Signs, to Pharaoh and his Chiefs: He said, "I am a messenger of the Lord of the Worlds."</AYA>
		<AYA id="043047">But when he came to them with Our Signs, behold, they laughed at them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="043048">We showed them Sign after Sign, each greater than its fellow, and We seized them with Punishment, in order that they might turn (to Us).</AYA>
		<AYA id="043049">And they said, "O thou sorcerer! Invoke thy Lord for us according to His covenant with thee; for we shall truly accept guidance."</AYA>
		<AYA id="043050">But when We removed the Chastisement from them, behold, they broke their word.</AYA>
		<AYA id="043051">And Pharaoh proclaimed among his people, saying: "O my people! Does not the dominion of Egypt belong to me, (witness) these streams flowing underneath my (palace)? What! see ye not then?</AYA>
		<AYA id="043052">"Am I not better than this (Moses), who is a contemptible wretch and can scarcely express himself clearly?</AYA>
		<AYA id="043053">"Then why are not gold bracelets bestowed on him, or (why) come (not) with him angels accompanying him in procession?"</AYA>
		<AYA id="043054">Thus did he make fools of his people, and they obeyed him: truly were they a people rebellious (against Allah).</AYA>
		<AYA id="043055">When at length they provoked Us, We exacted retribution from them, and We drowned them all.</AYA>
		<AYA id="043056">And We made them (a people) of the Past and an Example to later ages.</AYA>
		<AYA id="043057">When (Jesus) the son of Mary is held up as an example, behold, thy people raise a clamor thereat (in ridicule)!</AYA>
		<AYA id="043058">And they say, "Are our gods best, or he?" This they set forth to thee, only by way of disputation: yea, they are a contentious people.</AYA>
		<AYA id="043059">He was no more than a servant: We granted Our favor to him, and We made him an example to the Children of Israel.</AYA>
		<AYA id="043060">And if it were Our Will, We could make angels from amongst you, succeeding each other on the earth.</AYA>
		<AYA id="043061">And (Jesus) shall be a Sign (for the coming of) the Hour (of Judgment): therefore have no doubt about the (Hour), but follow ye Me: this is a Straight Way.</AYA>
		<AYA id="043062">Let not the Satan hinder you: for he is to you an enemy avowed.</AYA>
		<AYA id="043063">When Jesus came with Clear Signs, he said: "Now have I come to you with Wisdom, and in order to make clear to you some of the (points) on which ye dispute: therefore fear Allah and obey me.</AYA>
		<AYA id="043064">"For Allah, He is my Lord and your Lord: so worship ye Him: this is a Straight Way."</AYA>
		<AYA id="043065">But sects from among themselves fell into disagreement: then woe to the wrong-doers, from the Chastisement of a Grievous Day!</AYA>
		<AYA id="043066">Do they only wait for the Hour - that it should come on them all of a sudden, while they perceive not?</AYA>
		<AYA id="043067">Friends on that day will be foes, one to another,- except the Righteous.</AYA>
		<AYA id="043068">My devotees! No fear shall be on you today, nor shall ye grieve,-</AYA>
		<AYA id="043069">Those who have believed in Our Signs and submitted to Us.</AYA>
		<AYA id="043070">Enter ye the Garden, ye and your wives, in (beauty and) rejoicing.</AYA>
		<AYA id="043071">To them will be passed round, dishes and goblets of gold: there will be there all that the souls could desire, all that the eyes could delight in: and ye shall abide therein (for aye).</AYA>
		<AYA id="043072">Such will be the Garden of which ye are made heirs for your (good) deeds (in life).</AYA>
		<AYA id="043073">Ye shall have therein abundance of fruit, from which ye shall eat.</AYA>
		<AYA id="043074">The sinners will be in the Punishment of Hell, to dwell therein (for aye):</AYA>
		<AYA id="043075">Nowise will the (Punishment) be lightened for them, and in despair will they be there overwhelmed.</AYA>
		<AYA id="043076">Nowise shall We be unjust to them: but it is they who have been unjust themselves.</AYA>
		<AYA id="043077">They will cry: "O Mlik! Would that thy Lord put an end to us!" He will say, "Nay, but ye shall abide!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="043078">Verily We have brought the Truth to you: but most of you have a hatred for Truth.</AYA>
		<AYA id="043079">What! Have they settled some plan (among themselves)? But it is We Who settle things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="043080">Or do they think that We hear not their secrets and their private counsels? Indeed (We do), and Our messengers are by them, to record.</AYA>
		<AYA id="043081">Say: "If the Most Gracious had a son, I would be the fir 58e st to worship."</AYA>
		<AYA id="043082">Glory to the Lord of the heavens and the earth, the Lord of the Throne! He is free from the things they attribute (to Him)!</AYA>
		<AYA id="043083">So leave them to babble and play (with vanities) until they meet that Day of theirs, which they have been promised.</AYA>
		<AYA id="043084">It is He Who is God in heaven and God on earth; and He is full of Wisdom and Knowledge.</AYA>
		<AYA id="043085">And blessed is He to Whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth, and all between them: with Him is the Knowledge of the Hour (of Judgment): and to Him shall ye be brought back.</AYA>
		<AYA id="043086">And those whom they invoke besides Allah have no power of intercession;- only he who bears witness to the Truth, and with full knowledge.</AYA>
		<AYA id="043087">If thou ask them, who created them, they will certainly say, Allah. How then are they deluded away (from the Truth)?</AYA>
		<AYA id="043088">(Allah has knowledge) of the (Prophet's) cry, "O my Lord! Truly these are people who will not believe!"</AYA>

		<AYA id="045006">Such are the Signs of Allah, which We rehearse to thee in Truth; then in what exposition will they believe after Allah and His Signs?</AYA>
		<AYA id="045007">Woe to each sinful imposter:</AYA>
		<AYA id="045008">He hears the Signs of Allah rehearsed to him, yet is obstinate and lofty, as if he had not heard them: then announce to him a Chastisement Grievous!</AYA>
		<AYA id="045009">And when he learns something of Our Signs, he takes them in jest: for such there will be a humiliating Chastisement.</AYA>
		<AYA id="045010">In front of them is Hell: and of no profit to them is anything they may have earned, nor any protectors they may have taken to themselves besides Allah: for them is a tremendous Chastisements.</AYA>
		<AYA id="045011">This is (true) Guidance and for those who reject the Signs of their Lord, is a grievous Chastisement of abomination.</AYA>
		<AYA id="045012">It is Allah Who has subjected the sea to you, that ships may sail through it by His command, that ye may seek of His Bounty, and that ye may be grateful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="045013">And He has subjected to you, as from Him, all that is in the heavens and on earth: behold, in that are Signs indeed for those who reflect.</AYA>
		<AYA id="045014">Tell those who believe, to forgive those who do not hope for the Days of Allah: it is for Him to recompense (for good or ill) each People according to what they have earned.</AYA>
		<AYA id="045015">If any one does a righteous deed, it is to his own benefit; if he does evil, it works against (his own soul). In the end will ye (all) be brought back to your Lord.</AYA>
		<AYA id="045016">We did aforetime grant to the Children of Israel the Book the Power of Command, and Prophethood; We gave them, for Sustenance, things good and pure; and We favored them above the nations.</AYA>
		<AYA id="045017">And We granted them Clear Signs in affairs (of Religion): it was only after knowledge had been granted to them that they fell into schisms, through insolent envy among themselves. Verily thy Lord will judge between them on the Day of Judgment as to those matters in which they set up differences.</AYA>
		<AYA id="045018">Then We put thee on the (right) Way of Religion: so follow thou that (Way), and follow not the desires of those who know not.</AYA>

		<AYA id="045022">Allah created the heavens and the earth for just ends, and in order that each soul may find the recompense of what it has earned, and none of them shall be wronged.</AYA>
		<AYA id="045023">Then seest thou such a one as takes as his god his own vain desire?

		<AYA id="045026">Say: "It is Allah Who gives you life, then gives you death; then He will gather you together for the Day of Judgment about which there is no doubt": but most men do not know.</AYA>
		<AYA id="045027">To Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth, and the Day that the Hour of Judgment is established,- that Day will the followers of Falsehood perish!</AYA>
		<AYA id="045028">And thou wilt see every nation bowing the knee: every nation will be called to its Record: "This Day shall ye be recompensed for all that ye did!</AYA>
		<AYA id="045029">"This Our Record speaks about you with truth: For We were wont to put on record all that ye did."</AYA>

		<AYA id="045033">Then will appear to them the evil (fruits) of what they did, and they will be completely encircled by that which they used to mock at!</AYA>

		<AYA id="045035">"This, because ye used to take the Signs of Allah in jest, and the life of the world deceived you:" (From) that Day, therefore, they shall not be taken out thence, nor shall they make amends.</AYA>
		<AYA id="045036">Then Praise be to Allah, Lord of the heavens and Lord of the earth,- Lord and Cherisher of all the Worlds!</AYA>

		<AYA id="046005">And who is more astray than one who invokes, besides Allah, such as will not answer him to the Day of Judgment, and who (in fact) are unconscious of their call (to them)?</AYA>
		<AYA id="046006">And when mankind are gathered together (at the Resurrection), they will be hostile to them and deny that (men) had worshipped them!</AYA>
		<AYA id="046007">When Our Clear Signs are rehearsed to them, the Unbelievers say, of the Truth when it comes to them: "This is evident sorcery!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="046008">Or do they say, "He has forged it"? Say: "Had I forged it, then ye have no power to help me against Allah. He knows best of that whereof ye talk (so glibly)! Enough is He for a witness between me and you! And he is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful."</AYA>
		<AYA id="046009">Say: "I am not an innovation among the messengers, nor do I know what will be done with me or with you. I follow but that which is revealed to me by inspiration; I am but a Warner open and clear."</AYA>
		<AYA id="046010">Say: "See ye? If (this teaching) be from Allah, and ye reject it, and a witness from among the Children of Israel testifies to its similarity (with earlier scripture), and has believed while ye are arrogant, (how unjust ye are!) truly, Allah guides not a people unjust."</AYA>
		<AYA id="046011">The Unbelievers say of those who believe: "If (this Message) were a good thing, (such men) would not have gone to it first, before us!" And seeing that they guide not themselves thereby, they will say, "This is an old falsehood!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="046012">And before this, was the Book of Moses as a guide and a mercy: and this Book confirms (it) in the Arabic tongue; to admonish the unjust, and as Glad Tidings to those who do right.</AYA>
		<AYA id="046013">Verily those who say, "Our Lord is Allah," and remain firm (on that Path),- on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.</AYA>
		<AYA id="046014">Such shall be Companions of the Gardens, dwelling therein (for aye): a recompense for their (good) deeds.</AYA>
		<AYA id="046015">We have enjoined on man kindness to his parents: in pain did his mother bear him, and in pain did she give him birth. The carrying of the (child) to his weaning is (a period of) thirty months. At length, when he reaches the age of full strength and attains forty years, he says, "O my Lord! Grant me that I may be grateful for Thy favor which Thou has bestowed upon me, and upon both my parents, and that I may work righteousness such as Thou mayest approve; and be gracious to me in my issue. Truly have I turned to Thee and truly do I submit (to Thee) in Islm."</AYA>
		<AYA id="046016">Such are they from whom We shall accept the best of their deeds and pass by their ill deeds: (they shall be) among the Companions of the Garden: a promise of truth, which was made to them (in this life).</AYA>
		<AYA id="046017">But (there is one) who says to his parents, "Fie on you! Do ye hold out the promise to me that I shall be raised up, even though generations have passed before me (without rising again)?" And they two seek Allah's aid, (and rebuke the son): "Woe to thee! Have faith! For the promise of Allah is true." But he says, "This is nothing but tales of the ancients!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="046018">Such are they against whom proved true sentence among the previous generations of Jinns and men, that have passed away; for they will be (utterly) lost.</AYA>
		<AYA id="046019">And to all are (assigned) degrees according to the deeds which they (have done), and in order that (Allah) may recompense their deeds, and no injustice be done to them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="046020">And on the Day that the Unbelievers will be placed before the Fire, (It will be said to them): "Ye received your good things in the life of the world, and ye took your pleasure out of them: but today shall ye be recompensed with a Chastisement of humiliation: for that ye were arrogant on earth without just cause, and that ye (ever) transgressed."</AYA>
		<AYA id="046021">Mention (Hd) one of d's (own) brethren: behold, he warned his people beside the winding Sand-tracts: but there have been warners before him and after him: "Worship ye none other than Allah: truly I fear for you the Chastisement of a Mighty Day."</AYA>
		<AYA id="046022">They said: "Hast thou come in order to turn us aside from our gods? Then bring upon us the (calamity) with which thou dost threaten us, if thou art telling the truth!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="046023">He said: "The Knowledge (of when it will come) is only with Allah: I proclaim to you the mission on which I have been sent: but I see that ye are a people in ignorance!"..</AYA>
		<AYA id="046024">Then, when they saw a cloud advancing towards their valleys, they said, "This cloud will give us rain!" "Nay, it is the (Calamity) ye were asking to be hastened!- a wind wherein is a Grievous Chastisement!</AYA>
		<AYA id="046025">"Everything will it destroy by the command of its Lord!" Then by the morning they - nothing was to be seen but (the ruins of) their houses! Thus do We recompense those given to sin!</AYA>
		<AYA id="046026">And We had firmly established them in a (prosperity and) power which We have not given to you (ye Quraish!) and We had endowed them with (faculties of) hearing, seeing, heart and intellect: but of no profit to them were their (faculties of) hearing, sight, and heart and intellect, when they went on rejecting the Signs of Allah: and they were (completely) encircled by that which they used to mock at!</AYA>
		<AYA id="046027">We destroyed aforetime towns round about you; and We have shown the Signs in various ways, that they may turn (to Us).</AYA>
		<AYA id="046028">Why then was no help forthcoming to them from those whom they worshipped as gods, besides Allah, as a means of access (to Allah)? Nay, they left them in the lurch: but that was their falsehood and their invention.</AYA>
		<AYA id="046029">Behold, We turned towards thee a company of Jinns (quietly) listening to the Quran: when they stood in the presence thereof, they said, "Listen in silence!" When the (reading) was finished, they returned to their people, to warn them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="046030">They said, "O our people! We have heard a Book revealed after Moses, confirming what came before it: it guides (men) to the Truth and to a Straight Path.</AYA>
		<AYA id="046031">"O our people, hearken to the one who invites (you) to Allah, and believe in him: He will forgive you your faults, and deliver you from a Chastisement Grievous.</AYA>
		<AYA id="046032">"If any does not hearken to the one who invites (us) to Allah, he cannot escape in the earth, and no protectors can he have besides Allah: such men (are) in manifest error."</AYA>
		<AYA id="046033">See they not that Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth, and never wearied with their creation, is able to give life to the dead? Yea, verily He has power over all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="046034">And on the Day that the Unbelievers will be placed before the Fire, (they will be asked,) "Is this not the Truth?" they will say, "Yea, by our Lord!" (He will say:) "Then taste ye the Chastisement, for that ye were wont to deny (Truth)!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="046035">Therefore patiently persevere, as did (all) messengers of firm resolution; and be in no haste about the (Unbelievers). On the Day that they see the (Punishment) promised them, (it will be) as if they had not tarried more than an hour in a single day. (Thine but) to proclaim the Message: but shall any be destroyed except those who transgress?</AYA>

		<AYA id="047003">This because those who reject Allah follow falsehood, while those who believe follow the Truth from their Lord: thus does Allah set forth for men their lessons by similitudes.</AYA>
		<AYA id="047004">Therefore, when ye meet the Unbelievers (in fight), smite at their necks; at length, when ye have thoroughly subdued them, bind (the captives) firmly: thereafter (is the time for) either generosity or ransom: until the war lays down its burdens. Thus (are ye commanded): but if it had been Allah's Will, He could certainly have exacted retribution from them (Himself); but (He lets you fight) in order to test you, some with others. But those who are slain in the Way of Allah,- He will never let their deeds be lost.</AYA>

		<AYA id="047009">That is because they hate the Revelation of Allah; so He has made their deeds fruitless.</AYA>
		<AYA id="047010">Do they not travel through the earth, and see what was the End of those before them (who did evil)? Allah brought utter destruction on them, and similar (fates await) those who reject Allah.</AYA>
		<AYA id="047011">That is because Allah is the Protector of those who believe, but those who reject Allah have no protector.</AYA>
		<AYA id="047012">Verily Allah will admit those who believe and do righteous deeds, to Gardens beneath which rivers flow; while those who reject Allah will enjoy (this world) and eat as cattle eat; and the Fire will be their abode.</AYA>

In it there are for them all kinds of fruits; and Forgiveness from their Lord. (Can those in such Bliss) be compared to such as shall dwell for ever in the Fire, and be given, to drink, boiling water, so that it cuts up their bowels (to pieces)?</AYA>
		<AYA id="047016">And among them are men who listen to thee, till when they go out from thee, they say to those who have received Knowledge, "What is it he said just then?" Such are men whose hearts Allah has sealed, and who follow their own lusts.</AYA>

		<AYA id="047019">Know, therefore, that there is no god but Allah, and ask forgiveness for thy fault, and for the men and women who believe: for Allah knows how ye move about and how ye dwell in your homes.</AYA>
		<AYA id="047020">Those who believe say, "Why is not a Srah sent down (for us)?"

		<AYA id="047024">Do they not then earnestly seek to understand the Quran, or is it that there are Locks upon their hearts?</AYA>
		<AYA id="047025">Those who turn back as apostates after Guidance was clearly shown to them,- the Satan has instigated them and buoyed them up with false hopes.</AYA>
		<AYA id="047026">This, because they said to those who hate what Allah has revealed, "We will obey you in part of (this) matter"; but Allah knows their (inner) secrets.</AYA>

		<AYA id="048003">And that Allah may help thee with powerful help.</AYA>
		<AYA id="048004">It is He Who sent down tranquillity into the hearts of the Believers, that they may add faith to their faith;- for to Allah belong the Forces of the heavens and the earth; and Allah is Full of Knowledge and Wisdom;-</AYA>
		<AYA id="048005">That He may admit the men and women who believe, to Gardens beneath which rivers flow, to dwell therein for aye, and remove their ills from them;- and that is, in the sight of Allah, the highest achievement (for man),-</AYA>
		<AYA id="048006">And that He may punish the Hypocrites, men and women, and the Polytheists men and women, who imagine an evil opinion of Allah. On them is a round of Evil: the Wrath of Allah is on them: He has cursed them and got Hell ready for them: and evil is it for a destination.</AYA>
		<AYA id="048007">For to Allah belong the Forces of the heavens and the earth; and Allah is Exalted in Power, Full of Wisdom.</AYA>
		<AYA id="048008">We have truly sent thee as a witness, as a bringer of Glad Tidings, and as a Warner:</AYA>
		<AYA id="048009">In order that ye (O men) may believe in Allah and His Messenger, that ye may assist and honour Him, and celebrate His praise morning and evening.</AYA>
		<AYA id="048010">Verily those who plight their fealty to thee do no less than plight their fealty to Allah. the Hand of Allah is over their hands: then any one who violates his oath, does so to the harm of his own soul, and any one who fulfils what he has covenanted with Allah,- Allah will soon grant him a great Reward.</AYA>
		<AYA id="048011">The desert Arabs who lagged behind will say to thee: "We were engaged in (looking after) our flocks and herds, and our families: do thou then ask forgiveness for us." They say with their tongues what is not in their hearts. Say: "Who then has any power at all (to intervene) on your behalf with Allah, if His Will is to give you some loss or to give you some profit? But Allah is well acquainted with all that ye do.</AYA>
		<AYA id="048012">"Nay, ye thought that the Messenger and the Believers would never return to their families; this seemed pleasing in your hearts, and ye conceived an evil thought, for ye are a people lost (in wickedness)."</AYA>
		<AYA id="048013">And if any believe not in Allah and His Messenger, We have prepared, for those who reject Allah, a Blazing Fire!</AYA>
		<AYA id="048014">To Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth: He forgives whom He wills, and He punishes whom He wills: but Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="048015">Those who lagged behind (will say), when ye (are free to) march and take booty (in war): "Permit us to follow you." They wish to change Allah.s decree: Say: "Not thus will ye follow us: Allah has already declared (this) beforehand": then they will say, "But ye are jealous of us." Nay, but little do they understand (such things).</AYA>
		<AYA id="048016">Say to the desert Arabs who lagged behind: "Ye shall be summoned (to fight) against a people given to vehement war: then shall ye fight, or they shall submit. Then if ye show obedience, Allah will grant you a goodly reward, but if ye turn back as ye did before, He will punish you with a grievous Penalty."</AYA>
		<AYA id="048017">No blame is there on the blind, nor is there blame on the lame, nor on one ill (if he joins not the war): But he that obeys Allah and his Messenger,- ((Allah)) will admit him to Gardens beneath which rivers flow; and he who turns back, ((Allah)) will punish him with a grievous Penalty.</AYA>
		<AYA id="048018">Allah.s Good Pleasure was on the Believers when they swore Fealty to thee under the Tree: He knew what was in their hearts, and He sent down Tranquillity to them; and He rewarded them with a speedy Victory;</AYA>
		<AYA id="048019">And many gains will they acquire (besides): and Allah is Exalted in Power, Full of Wisdom.</AYA>
		<AYA id="048020">Allah has promised you many gains that ye shall acquire, and He has given you these beforehand; and He has restrained the hands of men from you; that it may be a Sign for the Believers, and that He may guide you to a Straight Path;</AYA>
		<AYA id="048021">And other gains (there are), which are not within your power, but which Allah has compassed: and Allah has power over all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="048022">If the Unbelievers should fight you, they would certainly turn their backs; then would they find neither protector nor helper.</AYA>
		<AYA id="048023">(Such has been) the practice (approved) of Allah already in the past: no change wilt thou find in the practice (approved) of Allah.</AYA>
		<AYA id="048024">And it is He Who has restrained their hands from you and your hands from them in the midst of Makka, after that He gave you the victory over them. And Allah sees well all that ye do.</AYA>
		<AYA id="048025">They are the ones who denied Revelation and hindered you from the Sacred Mosque and the sacrificial animals, detained from reaching their place of sacrifice. Had there not been believing men and believing women whom ye did not know that ye were trampling down and on whose account a crime would have accrued to you without (your) knowledge, ((Allah) would have allowed you to force your way, but He held back your hands) that He may admit to His Mercy whom He will. If they had been apart, We should certainly have punished the Unbelievers among them with a grievous Punishment.</AYA>
		<AYA id="048026">While the Unbelievers got up in their hearts heat and cant - the heat and cant of ignorance,- Allah sent down His Tranquillity to his Messenger and to the Believers, and made them stick close to the command of self-restraint; and well were they entitled to it and worthy of it. And Allah has full knowledge of all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="048027">Truly did Allah fulfil the vision for His Messenger. ye shall enter the Sacred Mosque, if Allah wills, with minds secure, heads shaved, hair cut short, and without fear. For He knew what ye knew not, and He granted, besides this, a speedy victory.</AYA>
		<AYA id="048028">It is He Who has sent His Messenger with Guidance and the Religion of Truth, to proclaim it over all religion: and enough is Allah for a Witness.</AYA>
		<AYA id="048029">Muhammad is the apostle of Allah. and those who are with him are strong against Unbelievers, (but) compassionate amongst each other. Thou wilt see them bow and prostrate themselves (in prayer), seeking Grace from Allah and (His) Good Pleasure. On their faces are their marks, (being) the traces of their prostration. This is their similitude in the Taurat; and their similitude in the Gospel is: like a seed which sends forth its blade, then makes it strong; it then becomes thick, and it stands on its own stem, (filling) the sowers with wonder and delight. As a result, it fills the Unbelievers with rage at them. Allah has promised those among them who believe and do righteous deeds forgiveness, and a great Reward.</AYA>

		<AYA id="057008">How is it with you that you believe not in Allah?- and the Messenger invites you to believe in your Lord, and has indeed taken your Covenant, if ye are men of Faith.</AYA>
		<AYA id="057009">He is the One Who sends to His Servant Manifest Signs, that He may lead you from the depths of Darkness into the Light and verily Allah is to you Most Kind and Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="057010">How is it with you that you spend not in the cause of Allah?- For to Allah belongs the heritage of the heavens and the earth. Not equal among you are those who spent (freely) and fought, before the Victory, (with those who did so later). Those are higher in rank than those who spent (freely) and fought afterwards. But to all has Allah promised a goodly (reward). And Allah is well acquainted with all that ye do.</AYA>

		<AYA id="057020">Know ye (all), that the life of this world is but play and pastime, adornment and mutual boasting and multiplying, (in rivalry) among yourselves, riches and children. Here is a similitude: how rain and the growth which it brings forth, delight (the hearts of) the tillers; soon it withers; thou wilt see it grow yellow; then it becomes dry and crumbles away. But in the Hereafter is a Chastisement severe (for the devotees of wrong). And Forgiveness from Allah and (His) Good Pleasure (for the devotees of Allah). And what is the life of this world, but goods and chattels of deception?</AYA>
		<AYA id="057021">Be ye foremost (in seeking) Forgiveness from your Lord, and a Garden (of Bliss), the width whereof is as the width of heaven and earth, prepared for those who believe in Allah and His messengers: that is the Grace of Allah, which He bestows on whom He pleases: and Allah is the Lord of Grace abounding.</AYA>
		<AYA id="057022">No misfortune can happen on earth or in your souls but is recorded in a Book before We bring it into existence: That is truly easy for Allah:</AYA>
		<AYA id="057023">In order that ye may not despair over matters that pass you by, nor exult over favors bestowed upon you. For Allah loveth not any vainglorious boaster,-</AYA>

		<AYA id="057025">We sent aforetime our messengers with Clear Signs and sent down with them the Book and the Balance (of Right and Wrong), that men may stand forth in justice; and We sent down Iron, in which is great might, as well as many benefits for mankind, that Allah may test who it is that will help, Unseen, Him and His messengers: For Allah is Full of Strength, Exalted in Might.</AYA>
		<AYA id="057026">And We sent Noah and Abraham, and established in their line Prophethood and Revelation: and some of them were on right guidance, but many of them became rebellious transgressors.</AYA>
		<AYA id="057027">Then, in their wake, We followed them up with (others of) Our messengers: We sent after them Jesus the son of Mary, and bestowed on him the Gospel; and We ordained in the hearts of those who followed him Compassion and Mercy. But the Monasticism which they invented for themselves, We did not prescribe for them: (We commanded) only the seeking for the Good Pleasure of Allah; but that they did not foster as they should have done. Yet We bestowed, on those among them who believed, their (due) reward, but many of them are rebellious transgressors.</AYA>
		<AYA id="057028">O ye that believe! Fear Allah, and believe in His Messenger, and He will bestow on you a double portion of His Mercy: He will provide for you a Light by which ye shall walk (straight in your path), and He will forgive you (your past): for Allah is Oft- Forgiving, Most Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="057029">That the People of the Book may know that they have no power whatever 14e over the Grace of Allah, that (His) Grace is (entirely) in His Hand, to bestow it on whomsoever He wills. For Allah is the Lord of Grace abounding.</AYA>

But pay the Unbelievers what they have spent (on their dower), and there will be no blame on you if ye marry them on payment of their dower to them. But hold not to the ties (marriage contract) of unbelieving women: ask for what ye have spent on their dowers, and let the (Unbelievers) ask for what they have spent (on the dowers of women who come over to you).

When believing women come to thee to take the oath of fealty to thee, that they will not associate in worship any other thing whatever with Allah, that they will not steal, that they will not commit adultery (or fornication), that they will not kill their children, that they will not utter slander, intentionally forging falsehood, and that they will not disobey thee in any just matter,- then do thou receive their fealty, and pray to Allah for the forgiveness (of their sins): for Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.</AYA>
