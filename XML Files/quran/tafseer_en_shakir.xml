	<SOURA id="2" name="The Cow">
		<AYA id="002001">Alif Lam Mim.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002002">This Book, there is no doubt in it, is a guide to those who guard (against evil).</AYA>
		<AYA id="002003">Those who believe in the unseen and keep up prayer and spend out of what We have given them</AYA>
		<AYA id="002004">And who believe in that which has been revealed to you and that which was revealed before you and they are sure of the hereafter.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002005">These are on a right course from their Lord and these it is that shall be successful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002006">Surely those who disbelieve, it being alike to them whether you warn them, or do not warn them, will not believe.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002007">Allah has set a seal upon their hearts and upon their hearing and there is a covering over their eyes, and there is a great punishment for them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002008">And there are some people who say: We believe in Allah and the last day; and they are not at all believers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002009">They desire to deceive Allah and those who believe, and they deceive only themselves and they do not perceive.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002010">There is a disease in their hearts, so Allah added to their disease and they shall have a painful chastisement because they lied.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002011">And when it is said to them, Do not make mischief in the land, they say: We are but peace-makers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002012">Now surely they themselves are the mischief makers, but they do not perceive.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002013">And when it is said to them: Believe as the people believe they say: Shall we believe as the fools believe? Now surely they themselves are the fools, but they do not know.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002014">And when they meet those who believe, they say: We believe; and when they are alone with their Shaitans, they say: Surely we are with you, we were only mocking.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002015">Allah shall pay them back their mockery, and He leaves them alone in their inordinacy, blindly wandering on.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002016">These are they who buy error for the right direction, so their bargain shall bring no gain, nor are they the followers of the right direction.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002017">Their parable is like the parable of one who kindled a fire but when it had illumined all around him, Allah took away their light, and left them in utter darkness-- they do not see.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002018">Deaf, dumb (and) blind, so they will not turn back.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002019">Or like abundant rain from the cloud in which is utter darkness and thunder and lightning; they put their fingers into their ears because of the thunder peal, for fear of death, and Allah encompasses the unbelievers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002020">The lightning almost takes away their sight; whenever it shines on them they walk in it, and when it becomes dark to them they stand still; and if Allah had pleased He would certainly have taken away their hearing and their sight; surely Allah has power over all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002021">O men! serve your Lord Who created you and those before you so that you may guard (against evil).</AYA>
		<AYA id="002022">Who made the earth a resting place for you and the heaven a canopy and (Who) sends down rain from the cloud then brings forth with it subsistence for you of the fruits; therefore do not set up rivals to Allah while you know.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002023">And if you are in doubt as to that which We have revealed to Our servant, then produce a chapter like it and call on your witnesses besides Allah if you are truthful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002024">But if you do (it) not and never shall you do (it), then be on your guard against the fire of which men and stones are the fuel; it is prepared for the unbelievers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002025">And convey good news to those who believe and do good deeds, that they shall have gardens in which rivers flow; whenever they shall be given a portion of the fruit thereof, they shall say: This is what was given to us before; and they shall be given the like of it, and they shall have pure mates in them, and in them, they shall abide.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002026">Surely Allah is not ashamed to set forth any parable-- (that of) a gnat or any thing above that; then as for those who believe, they know that it is the truth from their Lord, and as for those who disbelieve, they say: What is it that Allah means by this parable: He causes many to err by it and many He leads aright by it! but He does not cause to err by it (any) except the transgressors,</AYA>
		<AYA id="002027">Who break the covenant of Allah after its confirmation and cut asunder what Allah has ordered to be joined, and make mischief in the land; these it is that are the losers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002028">How do you deny Allah and you were dead and He gave you life? Again He will cause you to die and again bring you to life, then you shall be brought back to Him.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002029">He it is Who created for you all that is in the earth, and He directed Himself to the heaven, so He made them complete seven heavens, and He knows all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002030">And when your Lord said to the angels, I am going to place in the earth a khalif, they said: What! wilt Thou place in it such as shall make mischief in it and shed blood, and we celebrate Thy praise and extol Thy holiness? He said: Surely I know what you do not know.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002031">And He taught Adam all the names, then presented them to the angels; then He said: Tell me the names of those if you are right.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002032">They said: Glory be to Thee! we have no knowledge but that which Thou hast taught us; surely Thou art the Knowing, the Wise.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002033">He said: O Adam! inform them of their names. Then when he had informed them of their names, He said: Did I not say to you that I surely know what is ghaib in the heavens and the earth and (that) I know what you manifest and what you hide?</AYA>
		<AYA id="002034">And when We said to the angels: Make obeisance to Adam they did obeisance, but Iblis (did it not). He refused and he was proud, and he was one of the unbelievers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002035">And We said: O Adam! Dwell you and your wife in the garden and eat from it a plenteous (food) wherever you wish and do not approach this tree, for then you will be of the unjust.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002036">But the Shaitan made them both fall from it, and caused them to depart from that (state) in which they were; and We said: Get forth, some of you being the enemies of others, and there is for you in the earth an abode and a provision for a time.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002037">Then Adam received (some) words from his Lord, so He turned to him mercifully; surely He is Oft-returning (to mercy), the Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002038">We said: Go forth from this (state) all; so surely there will come to you a guidance from Me, then whoever follows My guidance, no fear shall come upon them, nor shall they grieve.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002039">And (as to) those who disbelieve in and reject My communications, they are the inmates of the fire, in it they shall abide.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002040">O children of Israel! call to mind My favor which I bestowed on you and be faithful to (your) covenant with Me, I will fulfill (My) covenant with you; and of Me, Me alone, should you be afraid.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002041">And believe in what I have revealed, verifying that which is with you, and be not the first to deny it, neither take a mean price in exchange for My communications; and Me, Me alone should you fear.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002042">And do not mix up the truth with the falsehood, nor hide the truth while you know (it).</AYA>
		<AYA id="002043">And keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate and bow down with those who bow down.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002044">What! do you enjoin men to be good and neglect your own souls while you read the Book; have you then no sense?</AYA>
		<AYA id="002045">And seek assistance through patience and prayer, and most surely it is a hard thing except for the humble ones,</AYA>
		<AYA id="002046">Who know that they shall meet their Lord and that they shall return to Him.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002047">O children of Israel! call to mind My favor which I bestowed on you and that I made you excel the nations.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002048">And be on your guard against a day when one soul shall not avail another in the least, neither shall intercession on its behalf be accepted, nor shall any compensation be taken from it, nor shall they be helped.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002049">And when We delivered you from Firon's people, who subjected you to severe torment, killing your sons and sparing your women, and in this there was a great trial from your Lord.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002050">And when We parted the sea for you, so We saved you and drowned the followers of Firon and you watched by.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002051">And when We appointed a time of forty nights with Musa, then you took the calf (for a god) after him and you were unjust.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002052">Then We pardoned you after that so that you might give thanks.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002053">And when We gave Musa the Book and the distinction that you might walk aright.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002054">And when Musa said to his people: O my people! you have surely been unjust to yourselves by taking the calf (for a god), therefore turn to your Creator (penitently), so kill your people, that is best for you with your Creator: so He turned to you (mercifully), for surely He is the Oft-returning (to mercy), the Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002055">And when you said: O Musa! we will not believe in you until we see Allah manifestly, so the punishment overtook you while you looked on.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002056">Then We raised you up after your death that you may give thanks.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002057">And We made the clouds to give shade over you and We sent to you manna and quails: Eat of the good things that We have given you; and they did not do Us any harm, but they made their own souls suffer the loss.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002058">And when We said: Enter this city, then eat from it a plenteous (food) wherever you wish, and enter the gate making obeisance, and say, forgiveness. We will forgive you your wrongs and give more to those who do good (to others).</AYA>
		<AYA id="002059">But those who were unjust changed it for a saying other than that which had been spoken to them, so We sent upon those who were unjust a pestilence from heaven, because they transgressed.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002060">And when Musa prayed for drink for his people, We said: Strike the rock with your staff So there gushed from it twelve springs; each tribe knew its drinking place: Eat and drink of the provisions of Allah and do not act corruptly in the land, making mischief.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002061">And when you said: O Musa! we cannot bear with one food, therefore pray Lord on our behalf to bring forth for us out of what the earth grows, of its herbs and its cucumbers and its garlic and its lentils and its onions. He said: Will you exchange that which is better for that which is worse? Enter a city, so you will have what you ask for. And abasement and humiliation were brought down upon them, and they became deserving of Allah's wrath; this was so because they disbelieved in the communications of Allah and killed the prophets unjustly; this was so because they disobeyed and exceeded the limits.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002062">Surely those who believe, and those who are Jews, and the Christians, and the Sabians, whoever believes in Allah and the Last day and does good, they shall have their reward from their Lord, and there is no fear for them, nor shall they grieve.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002063">And when We took a promise from you and lifted the mountain over you: Take hold of the law (Tavrat) We have given you with firmness and bear in mind what is in it, so that you may guard (against evil).</AYA>
		<AYA id="002064">Then you turned back after that; so were it not for the grace of Allah and His mercy on you, you would certainly have been among the losers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002065">And certainly you have known those among you who exceeded the limits of the Sabbath, so We said to them: Be (as) apes, despised and hated.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002066">So We made them an example to those who witnessed it and those who came after it, and an admonition to those who guard (against evil).</AYA>
		<AYA id="002067">And when Musa said to his people: Surely Allah commands you that you should sacrifice a cow; they said: Do you ridicule us? He said: I seek the protection of Allah from being one of the ignorant.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002068">They said: Call on your Lord for our sake to make it plain to us what she is. Musa said: He says, Surely she is a cow neither advanced in age nor too young, of middle age between that (and this); do therefore what you are commanded.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002069">They said: Call on your Lord for our sake to make it plain to us what her color is. Musa said: He says, Surely she is a yellow cow; her color is intensely yellow, giving delight to the beholders.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002070">They said: Call on your Lord for our sake to make it plain to us what she is, for surely to us the cows are all alike, and if Allah please we shall surely be guided aright.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002071">Musa said: He says, Surely she is a cow not made submissive that she should plough the land, nor does she irrigate the tilth; sound, without a blemish in her. They said: Now you have brought the truth; so they sacrificed her, though they had not the mind to do (it).</AYA>
		<AYA id="002072">And when you killed a man, then you disagreed with respect to that, and Allah was to bring forth that which you were going to hide.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002073">So We said: Strike the (dead body) with part of the (Sacrificed cow), thus Allah brings the dead to life, and He shows you His signs so that you may understand.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002074">Then your hearts hardened after that, so that they were like rocks, rather worse in hardness; and surely there are some rocks from which streams burst forth, and surely there are some of them which split asunder so water issues out of them, and surely there are some of them which fall down for fear of Allah, and Allah is not at all heedless of what you do.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002075">Do you then hope that they would believe in you, and a party from among them indeed used to hear the Word of Allah, then altered it after they had understood it, and they know (this).</AYA>
		<AYA id="002076">And when they meet those who believe they say: We believe, and when they are alone one with another they say: Do you talk to them of what Allah has disclosed to you that they may contend with you by this before your Lord? Do you not then understand?</AYA>
		<AYA id="002077">Do they not know that Allah knows what they keep secret and what they make known?</AYA>
		<AYA id="002078">And there arc among them illiterates who know not the Book but only lies, and they do but conjecture</AYA>
		<AYA id="002079">Woe, then, to those who write the book with their hands and then say: This is from Allah, so that they may take for it a small price; therefore woe to them for what their hands have written and woe to them for what they earn.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002080">And they say: Fire shall not touch us but for a few days. Say: Have you received a promise from Allah, then Allah will not fail to perform His promise, or do you speak against Allah what you do not know?</AYA>
		<AYA id="002081">Yeal whoever earns evil and his sins beset him on every side, these are the inmates of the fire; in it they shall abide.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002082">And (as for) those who believe and do good deeds, these are the dwellers of the garden; in it they shall abide.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002083">And when We made a covenant with the children of Israel: You shall not serve any but Allah and (you shall do) good to (your) parents, and to the near of kin and to the orphans and the needy, and you shall speak to men good words and keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate. Then you turned back except a few of you and (now too) you turn aside.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002084">And when We made a covenant with you: You shall not shed your blood and you shall not turn your people out of your cities; then you gave a promise while you witnessed.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002085">Yet you it is who slay your people and turn a party from among you out of their homes, backing each other up against them unlawfully and exceeding the limits; and if they should come to you, as captives you would ransom them-- while their very turning out was unlawful for you. Do you then believe in a part of the Book and disbelieve in the other? What then is the re ward of such among you as do this but disgrace in the life of this world, and on the day of resurrection they shall be sent back to the most grievous chastisement, and Allah is not at all heedless of what you do.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002086">These are they who buy the life of this world for the hereafter, so their chastisement shall not be lightened nor shall they be helped.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002087">And most certainly We gave Musa the Book and We sent apostles after him one after another; and We gave Isa, the son of Marium, clear arguments and strengthened him with the holy spirit, What! whenever then an apostle came to you with that which your souls did not desire, you were insolent so you called some liars and some you slew.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002088">And they say: Our hearts are covered. Nay, Allah has cursed them on account of their unbelief; so little it is that they believe.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002089">And when there came to them a Book from Allah verifying that which they have, and aforetime they used to pray for victory against those who disbelieve, but when there came to them (Prophet) that which they did not recognize, they disbelieved in him; so Allah's curse is on the unbelievers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002090">Evil is that for which they have sold their souls-- that they should deny what Allah has revealed, out of envy that Allah should send down of His grace on whomsoever of His servants He pleases; so they have made themselves deserving of wrath upon wrath, and there is a disgraceful punishment for the unbelievers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002091">And when it is said to them, Believe in what Allah has revealed, they say: We believe in that which was revealed to us; and they deny what is besides that, while it is the truth verifying that which they have. Say: Why then did you kill Allah's Prophets before if you were indeed believers?</AYA>
		<AYA id="002092">And most certainly Musa came to you with clear arguments, then you took the calf (for a god) in his absence and you were unjust.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002093">And when We made a covenant with you and raised the mountain over you: Take hold of what We have given you with firmness and be obedient. They said: We hear and disobey. And they were made to imbibe (the love of) the calf into their hearts on account of their unbelief Say: Evil is that which your belief bids you if you are believers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002094">Say: If the future abode with Allah is specially for you to the exclusion of the people, then invoke death if you are truthful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002095">And they will never invoke it on account of what their hands have sent before, and Allah knows the unjust.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002096">And you will most certainly find them the greediest of men for life (greedier) than even those who are polytheists; every one of them loves that he should be granted a life of a thousand years, and his being granted a long life will in no way remove him further off from the chastisement, and Allah sees what they</AYA>
		<AYA id="002097">Say: Whoever is the enemy of Jibreel-- for surely he revealed it to your heart by Allah's command, verifying that which is before it and guidance and good news for the believers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002098">Whoever is the enemy of Allah and His angels and His apostles and Jibreel and Meekaeel, so surely Allah is the enemy of the unbelievers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002099">And certainly We have revealed to you clear communications and none disbelieve in them except the transgressors.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002100">What! whenever they make a covenant, a party of them cast it aside? Nay, most of them do not believe.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002101">And when there came to them an Apostle from Allah verifying that which they have, a party of those who were given the Book threw the Book of Allah behind their backs as if they knew nothing.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002102">And they followed what the Shaitans chanted of sorcery in the reign of Sulaiman, and Sulaiman was not an unbeliever, but the Shaitans disbelieved, they taught men sorcery and that was sent down to the two angels at Babel, Harut and Marut, yet these two taught no man until they had said, "Surely we are only a trial, therefore do not be a disbeliever." Even then men learned from these two, magic by which they might cause a separation between a man and his wife; and they cannot hurt with it any one except with Allah's permission, and they learned what harmed them and did not profit them, and certainly they know that he who bought it should have no share of good in the hereafter and evil was the price for which they sold their souls, had they but known this.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002103">And if they had believed and guarded themselves (against evil), reward from Allah would certainly have been better; had they but known (this).</AYA>
		<AYA id="002104">O you who believe! do not say Raina and say Unzurna and listen, and for the unbelievers there is a painful chastisement.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002105">Those who disbelieve from among the followers of the Book do not like, nor do the polytheists, that the good should be sent down to you from your Lord, and Allah chooses especially whom He pleases for His mercy, and Allah is the Lord of mighty grace.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002106">Whatever communications We abrogate or cause to be forgotten, We bring one better than it or like it. Do you not know that Allah has power over all things?</AYA>
		<AYA id="002107">Do you not know that Allah's is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and that besides Allah you have no guardian or helper?</AYA>
		<AYA id="002108">Rather you wish to put questions to your Apostle, as Musa was questioned before; and whoever adopts unbelief instead of faith, he indeed has lost the right direction of the way.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002109">Many of the followers of the Book wish that they could turn you back into unbelievers after your faith, out of envy from themselves, (even) after the truth has become manifest to them; but pardon and forgive, so that Allah should bring about His command; surely Allah has power over all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002110">And keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate and whatever good you send before for yourselves, you shall find it with Allah; surely Allah sees what you do.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002111">And they say: None shall enter the garden (or paradise) except he who is a Jew or a Christian. These are their vain desires. Say: Bring your proof if you are truthful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002112">Yes! whoever submits himself entirely to Allah and he is the doer of good (to others) he has his reward from his Lord, and there is no fear for him nor shall he grieve.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002113">And the Jews say: The Christians do not follow anything (good) and the Christians say: The Jews do not follow anything (good) while they recite the (same) Book. Even thus say those who have no knowledge, like to what they say; so Allah shall judge between them on the day of resurrection in what they differ.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002114">And who is more unjust than he who prevents (men) from the masjids of Allah, that His name should be remembered in them, and strives to ruin them? (As for) these, it was not proper for them that they should have entered them except in fear; they shall meet with disgrace in this world, and they shall have great chastisement in the hereafter.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002115">And Allah's is the East and the West, therefore, whither you turn, thither is Allah's purpose; surely Allah is Amplegiving, Knowing.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002116">And they say: Allah has taken to himself a son. Glory be to Him; rather, whatever is in the heavens and the earth is His; all are obedient to Him.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002117">Wonderful Originator of the heavens and the earth, and when He decrees an affair, He only says to it, Be, so there it is.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002118">And those who have no knowledge say: Why does not Allah speak to us or a sign come to us? Even thus said those before them, the like of what they say; their hearts are all alike. Indeed We have made the communications clear for a people who are sure.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002119">Surely We have sent you with the truth as a bearer of good news and as a warner, and you shall not be called upon to answer for the companions of the flaming fire.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002120">And the Jews will not be pleased with you, nor the Christians until you follow their religion. Say: Surely Allah's guidance, that is the (true) guidance. And if you follow their desires after the knowledge that has come to you, you shall have no guardian from Allah, nor any helper.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002121">Those to whom We have given the Book read it as it ought to be read. These believe in it; and whoever disbelieves in it, these it is that are the losers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002122">O children of Israel, call to mind My favor which I bestowed on you and that I made you excel the nations.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002123">And.be on your guard against a day when no soul shall avail another in the least neither shall any compensation be accepted from it, nor shall intercession profit it, nor shall they be helped.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002124">And when his Lord tried Ibrahim with certain words, he fulfilled them. He said: Surely I will make you an Imam of men. Ibrahim said: And of my offspring? My covenant does not include the unjust, said He.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002125">And when We made the House a pilgrimage for men and a (place of) security, and: Appoint for yourselves a place of prayer on the standing-place of Ibrahim. And We enjoined Ibrahim and Ismail saying: Purify My House for those who visit (it) and those who abide (in it) for devotion and those who bow down (and) those who prostrate themselves.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002126">And when Ibrahim said: My Lord, make it a secure town and provide its people with fruits, such of them as believe in Allah and the last day. He said: And whoever disbelieves, I will grant him enjoyment for a short while, then I will drive him to the chastisement of the fire; and it is an evil destination.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002127">And when Ibrahim and Ismail raised the foundations of the House: Our Lord! accept from us; surely Thou art the Hearing, the Knowing:</AYA>
		<AYA id="002128">Our Lord! and make us both submissive to Thee and (raise) from our offspring a nation submitting to Thee, and show us our ways of devotion and turn to us (mercifully), surely Thou art the Oft-returning (to mercy), the Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002129">Our Lord! and raise up in them an Apostle from among them who shall recite to them Thy communications and teach them the Book and the wisdom, and purify them; surely Thou art the Mighty, the Wise.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002130">And who forsakes the religion of Ibrahim but he who makes himself a fool, and most certainly We chose him in this world, and in the hereafter he is most surely among the righteous.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002131">When his Lord said to him, Be a Muslim, he said: I submit myself to the Lord of the worlds.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002132">And the same did Ibrahim enjoin on his sons and (so did) Yaqoub. O my sons! surely Allah has chosen for you (this) faith, therefore die not unless you are Muslims.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002133">Nay! were you witnesses when death visited Yaqoub, when he said to his sons: What will you serve after me? They said: We will serve your God and the God of your fathers, Ibrahim and Ismail and Ishaq, one God only, and to Him do we submit</AYA>

		<AYA id="002141">This is a people that have passed away; they shall have what they earned and you shall have what you earn, and you shall not be called upon to answer for what they did.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002142">The fools among the people will say: What has turned them from their qiblah which they had? Say: The East and the West belong only to Allah; He guides whom He likes to the right path.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002143">And thus We have made you a medium (just) nation that you may be the bearers of witness to the people and (that) the Apostle may be a bearer of witness to you; and We did not make that which you would have to be the qiblah but that We might distinguish him who follows the Apostle from him who turns back upon his heels, and this was surely hard except for those whom Allah has guided aright; and Allah was not going to make your faith to be fruitless; most surely Allah is Affectionate, Merciful to the people.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002144">Indeed We see the turning of your face to heaven, so We shall surely turn you to a qiblah which you shall like; turn then your face towards the Sacred Mosque, and wherever you are, turn your face towards it, and those who have been given the Book most surely know that it is the truth from their Lord; and Allah is not at all heedless of what they do.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002145">And even if you bring to those who have been given the Book every sign they would not follow your qiblah, nor can you be a follower of their qiblah, neither are they the followers of each other's qiblah, and if you follow their desires after the knowledge that has come to you, then you shall most surely be among the unjust.</AYA>

		<AYA id="002151">Even as We have sent among you an Apostle from among you who recites to you Our communications and purifies you and teaches you the Book and the wisdom and teaches you that which you did not know.</AYA>

		<AYA id="002165">And there are some among men who take for themselves objects of worship besides Allah, whom they love as they love Allah, and those who believe are stronger in love for Allah and O, that those who are unjust had seen, when they see the chastisement, that the power is wholly Allah's and that Allah is severe in requiting (evil).</AYA>

		<AYA id="002168">O men! eat the lawful and good things out of what is in the earth, and do not follow the footsteps of the Shaitan; surely he is your open enemy.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002169">He only enjoins you evil and indecency, and that you may speak against Allah what you do not know.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002170">And when it is said to them, Follow what Allah has revealed, they say: Nay! we follow what we found our fathers upon. What! and though their fathers had no sense at all, nor did they follow the right way.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002171">And the parable of those who disbelieve is as the parable of one who calls out to that which hears no more than a call and a cry; deaf, dumb (and) blind, so they do not understand.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002172">O you who believe! eat of the good things that We have provided you with, and give thanks to Allah if Him it is that you serve.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002173">He has only forbidden you what dies of itself, and blood, and flesh of swine, and that over which any other (name) than (that of) Allah has been invoked; but whoever is driven to necessity, not desiring, nor exceeding the limit, no sin shall be upon him; surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002174">Surely those who conceal any part of the Book that Allah has revealed and take for it a small price, they eat nothing but fire into their bellies, and Allah will not speak to them on the day of resurrection, nor will He purify them, and they shall have a painful chastisement.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002175">These are they who buy error for the right direction and chastisement for forgiveness; how bold they are to encounter fire.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002176">This is because Allah has revealed the Book with the truth; and surely those who go against the Book are in a great opposition.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002177">It is not righteousness that you turn your faces towards the East and the West, but righteousness is this that one should believe in Allah and the last day and the angels and the Book and the prophets, and give away wealth out of love for Him to the near of kin and the orphans and the needy and the wayfarer and the beggars and for (the emancipation of) the captives, and keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate; and the performers of their promise when they make a promise, and the patient in distress and affliction and in time of conflicts-- these are they who are {rue (to themselves) and these are they who guard (against evil).</AYA>
		<AYA id="002178">O you who believe! retaliation is prescribed for you in the matter of the slain, the free for the free, and the slave for the slave, and the female for the female, but if any remission is made to any one by his (aggrieved) brother, then prosecution (for the bloodwit) should be made according to usage, and payment should be made to him in a good manner; this is an alleviation from your Lord and a mercy; so whoever exceeds the limit after this he shall have a painful chastisement.</AYA>

		<AYA id="002183">O you who believe! fasting is prescribed for you, as it was prescribed for those before you, so that you may guard (against evil).</AYA>
		<AYA id="002184">For a certain number of days; but whoever among you is sick or on a journey, then (he shall fast) a (like) number of other days; and those who are not able to do it may effect a redemption by feeding a poor man; so whoever does good spontaneously it is better for him; and that you fast is better for you if you know.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002185">The month of Ramazan is that in which the Quran was revealed, a guidance to men and clear proofs of the guidance and the distinction; therefore whoever of you is present in the month, he shall fast therein, and whoever is sick or upon a journey, then (he shall fast) a (like) number of other days; Allah desires ease for you, and He does not desire for you difficulty, and (He desires) that you should complete the number and that you should exalt the greatness of Allah for His having guided you and that you may give thanks.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002186">And when My servants ask you concerning Me, then surely I am very near; I answer the prayer of the suppliant when he calls on Me, so they should answer My call and believe in Me that they may walk in the right way.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002187">It is made lawful to you to go into your wives on the night of the fast; they are an apparel for you and you are an apparel for them; Allah knew that you acted unfaithfully to yourselves, so He has turned to you (mercifully) and removed from you (this burden); so now be in contact with them and seek what Allah has ordained for you, and eat and drink until the whiteness of the day becomes distinct from the blackness of the night at dawn, then complete the fast till night, and have not contact with them while you keep to the mosques; these are the limits of Allah, so do not go near them. Thus does Allah make clear His communications for men that they may guard (against evil).</AYA>
		<AYA id="002188">And do not swallow up your property among yourselves by false means, neither seek to gain access thereby to the judges, so that you may swallow up a part of the property of men wrongfully while you know.</AYA>

Say: They are times appointed for (the benefit of) men, and (for) the pilgrimage; and it is not righteousness that you should enter the houses at their backs, but righteousness is this that one should guard (against evil); and go into the houses by their doors and be careful (of your duty) to Allah, that you may be successful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002190">And fight in the way of Allah with those who fight with you, and do not exceed the limits, surely Allah does not love those who exceed the limits.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002191">And kill them wherever you find them, and drive them out from whence they drove you out, and persecution is severer than slaughter, and do not fight with them at the Sacred Mosque until they fight with you in it, but if they do fight you, then slay them; such is the recompense of the unbelievers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002192">But if they desist, then surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002193">And fight with them until there is no persecution, and religion should be only for Allah, but if they desist, then there should be no hostility except against the oppressors.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002194">The Sacred month for the sacred month and all sacred things are (under the law of) retaliation; whoever then acts aggressively against you, inflict injury on him according to the injury he has inflicted on you and be careful (of your duty) to Allah and know that Allah is with those who guard (against evil).</AYA>
		<AYA id="002195">And spend in the way of Allah and cast not yourselves to perdition with your own hands, and do good (to others); surely Allah loves the doers of good.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002196">And accomplish the pilgrimage and the visit for Allah, but if, you are prevented, (send) whatever offering is easy to obtain, and do not shave your heads until the offering reaches its destination; but whoever among you is sick or has an ailment of the head, he (should effect) a compensation by fasting or alms or sacrificing, then when you are secure, whoever profits by combining the visit with the pilgrimage (should take) what offering is easy to obtain; but he who cannot find (any offering) should fast for three days during the pilgrimage and for seven days when you return; these (make) ten (days) complete; this is for him whose family is not present in the Sacred Mosque, and be careful (of your duty) to Allah, and know that Allah is severe in requiting (evil).</AYA>
		<AYA id="002197">The pilgrimage is (performed in) the well-known months; so whoever determines the performance of the pilgrimage therein, there shall be no intercourse nor fornication nor quarrelling amongst one another; and whatever good you do, Allah knows it; and make provision, for surely the provision is the guarding of oneself, and be careful (of your duty) to Me, O men of understanding.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002198">There is no blame on you in seeking bounty from your Lord, so when you hasten on from "Arafat", then remember Allah near the Holy Monument, and remember Him as He has guided you, though before that you were certainly of the erring ones.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002199">Then hasten on from the Place from which the people hasten on and ask the forgiveness of Allah; surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002200">So when you have performed your devotions, then laud Allah as you lauded your fathers, rather a greater lauding. But there are some people who say, Our Lord! give us in the world, and they shall have no resting place.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002201">And there are some among them who say: Our Lord! grant us good in this world and good in the hereafter, and save us from the chastisement of the fire.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002202">They shall have (their) portion of what they have earned, and Allah is swift in reckoning.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002203">And laud Allah during the numbered days; then whoever hastens off in two days, there is no blame on him, and whoever remains behind, there is no blame on him, (this is) for him who guards (against evil), and be careful (of your duty) to Allah, and know that you shall be gathered together to Him.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002204">And among men is he whose speech about the life of this world causes you to wonder, and he calls on Allah to witness as to what is in his heart, yet he is the most violent of adversaries.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002205">And when he turn,s back, he runs along in the land that he may cause mischief in it and destroy the tilth and the stock, and Allah does not love mischief-making.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002206">And when it is said to him, guard against (the punish ment of) Allah; pride carries him off to sin, therefore hell is sufficient for him; and certainly it is an evil resting place.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002207">And among men is he who sells himself to seek the pleasure of Allah; and Allah is Affectionate to the servants.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002208">O you who believe! enter into submission one and all and do not follow the footsteps of Shaitan; surely he is your open enemy.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002209">But if you slip after clear arguments have come to you, then know that Allah is Mighty, Wise.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002210">They do not wait aught but that Allah should come to them in the shadows of the clouds along with the angels, and the matter has (already) been decided; and (all) matters are returned to Allah.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002211">Ask the Israelites how many a clear sign have We given them; and whoever changes the favor of Allah after it has come to him, then surely Allah is severe in requiting (evil).</AYA>
		<AYA id="002212">The life of this world is made to seem fair to those who disbelieve, and they mock those who believe, and those who guard (against evil) shall be above them on the day of resurrection; and Allah gives means of subsistence to whom he pleases without measure.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002213">(All) people are a single nation; so Allah raised prophets as bearers of good news and as warners, and He revealed with them the Book with truth, that it might judge between people in that in which they differed; and none but the very people who were given it differed about it after clear arguments had come to them, revolting among themselves; so Allah has guided by His will those who believe to the truth about which they differed and Allah guides whom He pleases to the right path.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002214">Or do you think that you would enter the garden while yet the state of those who have passed away before you has not come upon you; distress and affliction befell them and they were shaken violently, so that the Apostle and those who believed with him said: When will the help of Allah come? Now surely the help of Allah is nigh!</AYA>
		<AYA id="002215">They ask you as to what they should spend. Say: Whatever wealth you spend, it is for the parents and the near of kin and the orphans and the needy and the wayfarer, and whatever good you do, Allah surely knows it.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002216">Fighting is enjoined on you, and h is an object of dislike to you; and it may be that you dislike a thing while it is good for you, and it may be that you love a thing while it is evil for you, and Allah knows, while you do not know.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002217">They ask you concerning the sacred month about fighting in it. Say: Fighting in it is a grave matter, and hindering (men) from Allah's way and denying Him, and (hindering men from) the Sacred Mosque and turning its people out of it, are still graver with Allah, and persecution is graver than slaughter; and they will not cease fighting with you until they turn you back from your religion, if they can; and whoever of you turns back from his religion, then he dies while an unbeliever-- these it is whose works shall go for nothing in this world and the hereafter, and they are the inmates of the fire; therein they shall abide.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002218">Surely those who believed and those who fled (their home) and strove hard in the way of Allah these hope for the mercy of Allah and Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002219">They ask you about intoxicants and games of chance. Say: In both of them there is a great sin and means of profit for men, and their sin is greater than their profit. And they ask you as to what they should spend. Say: What you can spare. Thus does Allah make clear to you the communications, that you may ponder</AYA>
		<AYA id="002220">On this world and the hereafter. And they ask you concerning the orphans Say: To set right for them (their affairs) is good, and if you become co-partners with them, they are your brethren; and Allah knows the mischief-maker and the pacemaker, and if Allah had pleased, He would certainly have caused you to fall into a difficulty; surely Allah is Mighty, Wise.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002221">And do not marry the idolatresses until they believe, and certainly a believing maid is better than an idolatress woman, even though she should please you; and do not give (believing women) in marriage to idolaters until they believe, and certainly a believing servant is better than an idolater, even though he should please you; these invite to the fire, and Allah invites to the garden and to forgiveness by His will, and makes clear His communications to men, that they may be mindful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002222">And they ask you about menstruation. Say: It is a discomfort; therefore keep aloof from the women during the menstrual discharge and do not go near them until they have become clean; then when they have cleansed themselves, go in to them as Allah has commanded you; surely Allah loves those who turn much (to Him), and He loves those who purify themselves.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002223">Your wives are a tilth for you, so go into your tilth when you like, and do good beforehand for yourselves, and be careful (of your duty) to Allah, and know that you will meet Him, and give good news to the believers.</AYA>

		<AYA id="002228">And the divorced women should keep themselves in waiting for three courses; and it is not lawful for them that they should conceal what Allah has created in their wombs, if they believe in Allah and the last day; and their husbands have a better right to take them back in the meanwhile if they wish for reconciliation; and they have rights similar to those against them in a just manner, and the men are a degree above them, and Allah is Mighty, Wise.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002229">Divorce may be (pronounced) twice, then keep (them) in good fellowship or let (them) go with kindness; and it is not lawful for you to take any part of what you have given them, unless both fear that they cannot keep within the limits of Allah; then if you fear that they cannot keep within the limits of Allah, there is no blame on them for what she gives up to become free thereby. These are the limits of Allah, so do not exceed them and whoever exceeds the limits of Allah these it is that are the unjust.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002230">So if he divorces her she shall not be lawful to him afterwards until she marries another husband; then if he divorces her there is no blame on them both if they return to each other (by marriage), if they think that they can keep within the limits of Allah, and these are the limits of Allah which He makes clear for a people who know.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002231">And when you divorce women and they reach their prescribed time, then either retain them in good fellowship or set them free with liberality, and do not retain them for injury, so that you exceed the limits, and whoever does this, he indeed is unjust to his own soul; and do not take Allah's communications for a mockery, and remember the favor of Allah upon you, and that which He has revealed to you of the Book and the Wisdom, admonishing you thereby; and be careful (of your duty to) Allah, and know that Allah is the Knower of all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002232">And when you have divorced women and they have ended-- their term (of waiting), then do not prevent them from marrying their husbands when they agree among themselves in a lawful manner; with this is admonished he among you who believes in Allah and the last day, this is more profitable and purer for you; and Allah knows while you do not know.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002233">And the mothers should suckle their children for two whole years for him who desires to make complete the time of suckling; and their maintenance and their clothing must be-- borne by the father according to usage; no soul shall have imposed upon it a duty but to the extent of its capacity; neither shall a mother be made to suffer harm on account of her child, nor a father on account of his child, and a similar duty (devolves) on the (father's) heir, but if both desire weaning by mutual consent and counsel, there is no blame on them, and if you wish to engage a wet-nurse for your children, there is no blame on you so long as you pay what you promised for according to usage; and be careful of (your duty to) Allah and know that Allah sees what you do.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002234">And (as for) those of you who die and leave wives behind, they should keep themselves in waiting for four months and ten days; then when they have fully attained their term, there is no blame on you for what they do for themselves in a lawful manner; and Allah is aware of what you do.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002235">And there is no blame on you respecting that which you speak indirectly in the asking of (such) women in marriage or keep (the proposal) concealed within your minds; Allah knows that you win mention them, but do not give them a promise in secret unless you speak in a lawful manner, and do not confirm the marriage tie until the writing is fulfilled, and know that Allah knows what is in your minds, therefore beware of Him, and know that Allah is Forgiving, Forbearing.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002236">There is no blame on you if you divorce women when you have not touched them or appointed for them a portion, and make provision for them, the wealthy according to his means and the straitened in circumstances according to his means, a provision according to usage; (this is) a duty on the doers of good (to others).</AYA>
		<AYA id="002237">And if you divorce them before you have touched them and you have appointed for them a portion, then (pay to them) ha!f of what you have appointed, unless they relinquish or he should relinquish in whose hand is the marriage tie; and it is nearer to righteousness that you should relinquish; and do not neglect the giving of free gifts between you; surely Allah sees what you do.</AYA>

He said: May it not be that you would not fight if fighting is ordained for you? They said: And what reason have we that we should not fight in the way of Allah, and we have indeed been compelled to abandon our homes and our children. But when fighting was ordained for them, they turned back, except a few of them, and Allah knows the unjust.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002247">And their prophet said to them: Surely Allah has raised Talut to be a king over you. They said: How can he hold kingship over us while we have a greater right to kingship than he, and he has not been granted an abundance of wealth? He said: Surely Allah has chosen him in preference to you, and He has increased him abundantly in knowledge and physique, and Allah grants His kingdom to whom He pleases, and Allah is Amplegiving, Knowing.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002248">And the prophet said to them: Surely the sign of His kingdom is, that there shall come to you the chest in which there is tranquillity from your Lord and residue of the relics of what the children of Musa and the children of Haroun have left, the angels bearing it; most surely there is a sign in this for those who believe.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002249">So when Talut departed with the forces, he said: Surely Allah will try you with a river; whoever then drinks from it, he is not of me, and whoever does not taste of it, he is surely of me, except he who takes with his hand as much of it as fills the hand; but with the exception of a few of them they drank from it. So when he had crossed it, he and those who believed with him, they said: We have today no power against Jalut and his forces. Those who were sure that they would meet their Lord said: How often has a small party vanquished a numerous host by Allah's permission, and Allah is with the patient.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002250">And when they went out against Jalut and his forces they said: Our Lord, pour down upon us patience, and make our steps firm and assist us against the unbelieving people.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002251">So they put them to flight by Allah's permission. And Dawood slew Jalut, and Allah gave him kingdom and wisdom, and taught him of what He pleased. And were it not for Allah's repelling some men with others, the earth would certainly be in a state of disorder; but Allah is Gracious to the creatures.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002252">These are the communications of Allah: We recite them to you with truth; and most surely you are (one) of the apostles.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002253">We have made some of these apostles to excel the others among them are they to whom Allah spoke, and some of them He exalted by (many degrees of) rank; and We gave clear miracles to Isa son of Marium, and strengthened him with the holy spirit. And if Allah had pleased, those after them would not have fought one with another after clear arguments had come to them, but they disagreed; so there were some of them who believed and others who denied; and if Allah had pleased they would not have fought one with another, but Allah brings about what He intends.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002254">O you who believe! spend out of what We have given you before the day comes in which there is no bargaining, neither any friendship nor intercession, and the unbelievers-- they are the unjust.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002255">Allah is He besides Whom there is no god, the Everliving, the Self-subsisting by Whom all subsist; slumber does not overtake Him nor sleep; whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth is His; who is he that can intercede with Him but by His permission? He knows what is before them and what is behind them, and they cannot comprehend anything out of His knowledge except what He pleases, His knowledge extends over the heavens and the earth, and the preservation of them both tires Him not, and He is the Most High, the Great.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002256">There is no compulsion in religion; truly the right way has become clearly distinct from error; therefore, whoever disbelieves in the Shaitan and believes in Allah he indeed has laid hold on the firmest handle, which shall not break off, and Allah is Hearing, Knowing.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002257">Allah is the guardian of those who believe. He brings them out of the darkness into the light; and (as to) those who disbelieve, their guardians are Shaitans who take them out of the light into the darkness; they are the inmates of the fire, in it they shall abide.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002258">Have you not considered him (Namrud) who disputed with Ibrahim about his Lord, because Allah had given him the kingdom? When Ibrahim said: My Lord is He who gives life and causes to die, he said: I give life and cause death. Ibrahim said: So surely Allah causes the sun to rise from the east, then make it rise from the west; thus he who disbelieved was confounded; and Allah does not guide aright the unjust people.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002259">Or the like of him (Uzair) who passed by a town, and it had fallen down upon its roofs; he said: When will Allah give it life after its death? So Allah caused him to die for a hundred years, then raised him to life. He said: How long have you tarried? He said: I have tarried a day, or a part of a day. Said He: Nay! you have tarried a hundred years; then look at your food and drink-- years have not passed over it; and look at your ass; and that We may make you a sign to men, and look at the bones, how We set them together, then clothed them with flesh; so when it became clear to him, he said: I know that Allah has power over all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002260">And when Ibrahim said: My Lord! show me how Thou givest life to the dead, He said: What! and do you not believe? He said: Yes, but that my heart may be at ease. He said: Then take four of the birds, then train them to follow you, then place on every mountain a part of them, then call them, they will come to you flying; and know that Allah is Mighty, Wise.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002261">The parable of those who spend their property in the way of Allah is as the parable of a grain growing seven ears (with) a hundred grains in every ear; and Allah multiplies for whom He pleases; and Allah is Ample-giving, Knowing</AYA>
		<AYA id="002262">(As for) those who spend their property in the way.of Allah, then do not follow up what they have spent with reproach or injury, they shall have their reward from their Lord, and they shall have no fear nor shall they grieve.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002263">Kind speech and forgiveness is better than charity followed by injury; and Allah is Self-sufficient, Forbearing.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002264">O you who believe! do not make your charity worthless by reproach and injury, like him who spends his property to be seen of men and does not believe in Allah and the last day; so his parable is as the parable of a smooth rock with earth upon it, then a heavy rain falls upon it, so it leaves it bare; they shall not be able to gain anything of what they have earned; and Allah does not guide the unbelieving people.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002265">And the parable of those who spend their property to seek the pleasure of Allah and for the certainty 'of their souls is as the parable of a garden on an elevated ground, upon which heavy rain falls so it brings forth its fruit twofold but if heavy rain does not fall upon it, then light rain (is sufficient); and Allah sees what you do.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002266">Does one of you like that he should have a garden of palms and vines with streams flowing beneath it; he has in it all kinds of fruits; and old age has overtaken him and he has weak offspring, when, (lo!) a whirlwind with fire in it smites it so it becomes blasted; thus Allah makes the communications clear to you, that you may reflect.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002267">O you who believe! spend (benevolently) of the good things that you earn and or what We have brought forth for you out of the earth, and do not aim at what is bad that you may spend (in alms) of it, while you would not take it yourselves unless you have its price lowered, and know that Allah is Self-sufficient, Praiseworthy.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002268">Shaitan threatens you with poverty and enjoins you to be niggardly, and Allah promises you forgiveness from Himself and abundance; and Allah is Ample-giving, Knowing.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002269">He grants wisdom to whom He pleases, and whoever is granted wisdom, he indeed is given a great good and none but men of understanding mind.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002270">And whatever alms you give or (whatever) vow you vow, surely Allah knows it; and the unjust shall have no helpers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002271">If you give alms openly, it is well, and if you hide it and give it to the poor, it is better for you; and this will do away with some of your evil deeds; and Allah is aware of what you do.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002272">To make them walk in the right way is not incumbent on you, but Allah guides aright whom He pleases; and whatever good thing you spend, it is to your own good; and you do not spend but to seek Allah's pleasure; and whatever good things you spend shall be paid back to you in full, and you shall not be wronged.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002273">(Alms are) for the poor who are confined in the way of Allah-- they cannot go about in the land; the ignorant man thinks them to be rich on account of (their) abstaining (from begging); you can recognise them by their mark; they do not beg from men importunately; and whatever good thing you spend, surely Allah knows it.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002274">(As for) those who spend their property by night and by day, secretly and openly, they shall have their reward from their Lord and they shall have no fear, nor shall they grieve.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002275">Those who swallow down usury cannot arise except as one whom Shaitan has prostrated by (his) touch does rise. That is because they say, trading is only like usury; and Allah has allowed trading and forbidden usury. To whomsoever then the admonition has come from his Lord, then he desists, he shall have what has already passed, and his affair is in the hands of Allah; and whoever returns (to it)-- these arc the inmates of the fire; they shall abide in it.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002276">Allah does not bless usury, and He causes charitable deeds to prosper, and Allah does not love any ungrateful sinner.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002277">Surely they who believe and do good deeds and keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate they shall have their reward from their Lord, and they shall have no fear, nor shall they grieve.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002278">O you who believe! Be careful of (your duty to) Allah and relinquish what remains (due) from usury, if you are believers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002279">But if you do (it) not, then be apprised of war from Allah and His Apostle; and if you repent, then you shall have your capital; neither shall you make (the debtor) suffer loss, nor shall you be made to suffer loss.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002280">And if (the debtor) is in straitness, then let there be postponement until (he is in) ease; and that you remit (it) as alms is better for you, if you knew.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002281">And guard yourselves against a day in which you shall be returned to Allah; then every soul shall be paid back in full what it has earned, and they shall not be dealt with unjustly.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002282">O you who believe! when you deal with each other in contracting a debt for a fixed time, then write it down; and let a scribe write it down between you with fairness; and the scribe should not refuse to write as Allah has taught him, so he should write; and let him who owes the debt dictate, and he should be careful of (his duty to) Allah, his Lord, and not diminish anything from it; but if he who owes the debt is unsound in understanding, or weak, or (if) he is not able to dictate himself, let his guardian dictate with fairness; and call in to witness from among your men two witnesses; but if there are not two men, then one man and two women from among those whom you choose to be witnesses, so that if one of the two errs, the second of the two may remind the other; and the witnesses should not refuse when they are summoned; and be not averse to writing it (whether it is) small or large, with the time of its falling due; this is more equitable in the sight of Allah and assures greater accuracy in testimony, and the nearest (way) that you may not entertain doubts (afterwards), except when it is ready merchandise which you give and take among yourselves from hand to hand, then there is no blame on you in not writing it down; and have witnesses when you barter with one another, and let no harm be done to the scribe or to the witness; and if you do (it) then surely it will be a transgression in you, and be careful of (your duty) to Allah, Allah teaches you, and Allah knows all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002283">And if you are upon a journey and you do not find a scribe, then (there may be) a security taken into possession; but if one of you trusts another, then he who is trusted should deliver his trust, and let him be careful (of his duty to) Allah, his Lord; and do not conceal testimony, and whoever conceals it, his heart is surely sinful; and Allah knows what you do.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002284">Whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth is Allah's; and whether you manifest what is in your minds or hide it, Allah will call you to account according to it; then He will forgive whom He pleases and chastise whom He pleases, and Allah has power over all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002285">The apostle believes in what has been revealed to him from his Lord, and (so do) the believers; they all believe in Allah and His angels and His books and His apostles; We make no difference between any of His apostles; and they say: We hear and obey, our Lord! Thy forgiveness (do we crave), and to Thee is the eventual course.</AYA>
		<AYA id="002286">Allah does not impose upon any soul a duty but to the extent of its ability; for it is (the benefit of) what it has earned and upon it (the evil of) what it has wrought: Our Lord! do not punish us if we forget or make a mistake; Our Lord! do not lay on us a burden as Thou didst lay on those before us, Our Lord do not impose upon us that which we have not the strength to bear; and pardon us and grant us protection and have mercy on us, Thou art our Patron, so help us against the unbelieving people.</AYA>

		<AYA id="003001">Alif Lam Mim.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003002">Allah, (there is) no god but He, the Everliving, the Self-subsisting by Whom all things subsist</AYA>
		<AYA id="003003">He has revealed to you the Book with truth, verifying that which is before it, and He revealed the Tavrat and the Injeel aforetime, a guidance for the people, and He sent the Furqan.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003004">Surely they who disbelieve in the communications of Allah they shall have a severe chastisement; and Allah is Mighty, the Lord of retribution.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003005">Allah-- surely nothing is hidden from Him in the earth or in the heaven.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003006">He it is Who shapes you in the wombs as He likes; there is no god but He, the Mighty, the Wise</AYA>
		<AYA id="003007">He it is Who has revealed the Book to you; some of its verses are decisive, they are the basis of the Book, and others are allegorical; then as for those in whose hearts there is perversity they follow the part of it which is allegorical, seeking to mislead and seeking to give it (their own) interpretation. but none knows its interpretation except Allah, and those who are firmly rooted in knowledge say: We believe in it, it is all from our Lord; and none do mind except those having understanding.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003008">Our Lord! make not our hearts to deviate after Thou hast guided us aright, and grant us from Thee mercy; surely Thou art the most liberal Giver.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003009">Our Lord! surely Thou art the Gatherer of men on a day about which there is no doubt; surely Allah will not fail (His) promise.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003010">(As for) those who disbelieve, surely neither their wealth nor their children shall avail them in the least against Allah, and these it is who are the fuel of the fire.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003011">Like the striving of the people of Firon and those before them; they rejected Our communications, so Allah destroyed them on account of their faults; and Allah is severe in requiting (evil).</AYA>
		<AYA id="003012">Say to those who disbelieve: You shall be vanquished, and driven together to hell; and evil is the resting-place.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003013">Indeed there was a sign for you in the two hosts (which) met together in encounter; one party fighting in the way of Allah and the other unbelieving, whom they saw twice as.many as themselves with the sight of the eye and Allah strengthens with His aid whom He pleases; most surely there is a lesson in this for those who have sight.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003014">The love of desires, of women and sons and hoarded treasures of gold and silver and well bred horses and cattle and tilth, is made to seem fair to men; this is the provision of the life of this world; and Allah is He with Whom is the good goal (of life).</AYA>
		<AYA id="003015">Say:Shall I tell you what is better than these? For those who guard (against evil) are gardens with their Lord, beneath which rivers flow, to abide in them, and pure mates and Allah's pleasure; and Allah sees the servants.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003016">Those who say: Our Lord! surely we believe, therefore forgive us our faults and save us from the chastisement of the fire.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003017">The patient, and the truthful, and the obedient, and those who spend (benevolently) and those who ask forgiveness in the morning times.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003018">Allah bears witness that there is no god but He, and (so do) the angels and those possessed of knowledge, maintaining His creation with justice; there is no god but He, the Mighty, the Wise.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003019">Surely the (true) religion with Allah is Islam, and those to whom the Book had been given did not show opposition but after knowledge had come to them, out of envy among themselves; and whoever disbelieves in the communications of Allah then surely Allah is quick in reckoning.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003020">But if they dispute with you, say: I have submitted myself entirely to Allah and (so) every one who follows me; and say to those who have been given the Book and the unlearned people: Do you submit yourselves? So if they submit then indeed they follow the right way; and if they turn back, then upon you is only the delivery of the message and Allah sees the servants.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003021">Surely (as for) those who disbelieve in the communications of Allah and slay the prophets unjustly and slay those among men who enjoin justice, announce to them a painful chastisement.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003022">Those are they whose works shall become null in this world as well as the hereafter, and they shall have no helpers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003023">Have you not considered those (Jews) who are given a portion of the Book? They are invited to the Book of Allah that it might decide between them, then a part of them turn back and they withdraw.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003024">This is because they say: The fire shall not touch us but for a few days; and what they have forged deceives them in the matter of their religion.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003025">Then how will it be when We shall gather them together on a day about which there is no doubt, and every soul shall be fully paid what it has earned, and they shall not be dealt with unjustly?</AYA>
		<AYA id="003026">Say: O Allah, Master of the Kingdom! Thou givest the kingdom to whomsoever Thou pleasest and takest away the kingdom from whomsoever Thou pleasest, and Thou exaltest whom Thou pleasest and abasest whom Thou pleasest in Thine hand is the good; surety, Thou hast power over all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003027">Thou makest the night to pass into the day and Thou makest the day to pass into the night, and Thou bringest forth the living from the dead and Thou bringest forth the dead from the living, and Thou givest sustenance to whom Thou pleasest without measure.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003028">Let not the believers take the unbelievers for friends rather than believers; and whoever does this, he shall have nothing of (the guardianship of) Allah, but you should guard yourselves against them, guarding carefully; and Allah makes you cautious of (retribution from) Himself; and to Allah is the eventual coming.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003029">Say: Whether you hide what is in your hearts or manifest it, Allah knows it, and He knows whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth, and Allah has power over all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003030">On the day that every soul shall find present what it has done of good and what it has done of evil, it shall wish that between it and that (evil) there were a long duration of time; and Allah makes you to be cautious of (retribution from) Himself; and Allah is Compassionate to the servants.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003031">Say: If you love Allah, then follow me, Allah will love you and forgive you your faults, and Allah is Forgiving, MercifuL</AYA>
		<AYA id="003032">Say: Obey Allah and the Apostle; but if they turn back, then surely Allah does not love the unbelievers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003033">Surely Allah chose Adam and Nuh and the descendants of Ibrahim and the descendants of Imran above the nations.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003034">Offspring one of the other; and Allah is Hearing, Knowing.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003035">When a woman of Imran said: My Lord! surely I vow to Thee what is in my womb, to be devoted (to Thy service); accept therefore from me, surely Thou art the Hearing, the Knowing.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003036">So when she brought forth, she said: My Lord! Surely I have brought it forth a female-- and Allah knew best what she brought forth-- and the male is not like the female, and I have named it Marium, and I commend her and her offspring into Thy protection from the accursed Shaitan.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003037">So her Lord accepted her with a good acceptance and made her grow up a good growing, and gave her into the charge of Zakariya; whenever Zakariya entered the sanctuary to (see) her, he found with her food. He said: O Marium! whence comes this to you? She said: It is from Allah. Surely Allah gives to whom He pleases without measure.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003038">There did Zakariya pray to his Lord; he said: My Lord! grant me from Thee good offspring; surely Thou art the Hearer of prayer.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003039">Then the angels called to him as he stood praying in the sanctuary: That Allah gives you the good news of Yahya verifying a Word from Allah, and honorable and chaste and a prophet from among the good ones.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003040">He said: My Lord! when shall there be a son (born) to me, and old age has already come upon me, and my wife is barren? He said: even thus does Allah what He pleases.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003041">He said: My Lord! appoint a sign for me. Said He: Your sign is that you should not speak to men for three days except by signs; and remember your Lord much and glorify Him in the evening and the morning.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003042">And when the angels said: O Marium! surely Allah has chosen you and purified you and chosen you above the women of of the world.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003043">O Marium! keep to obedience to your Lord and humble yourself, and bow down with those who bow.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003044">This is of the announcements relating to the unseen which We reveal to you; and you were not with them when they cast their pens (to decide) which of them should have Marium in his charge, and you were not with them when they contended one with another.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003045">When the angels said: O Marium, surely Allah gives you good news with a Word from Him (of one) whose name is the '. Messiah, Isa son of Marium, worthy of regard in this world and the hereafter and of those who are made near (to Allah).</AYA>
		<AYA id="003046">And he shall speak to the people when in the cradle and when of old age, and (he shall be) one of the good ones.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003047">She said: My Lord! when shall there be a son (born) to I me, and man has not touched me? He said: Even so, Allah creates what He pleases; when He has decreed a matter, He only says to it, Be, and it is.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003048">And He will teach him the Book and the wisdom and the Tavrat and the Injeel.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003049">And (make him) an apostle to the children of Israel: That I have come to you with a sign from your Lord, that I determine for you out of dust like the form of a bird, then I breathe into it and it becomes a bird with Allah's permission and I heal the blind and the leprous, and bring the dead to life with Allah's permission and I inform you of what you should eat and what you should store in your houses; most surely there is a sign in this for you, if you are believers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003050">And a verifier of that which is before me of the Taurat and that I may allow you part of that which has been forbidden t you, and I have come to you with a sign from your Lord therefore be careful of (your duty to) Allah and obey me.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003051">Surely Allah is my Lord and your Lord, therefore serve Him; this is the right path.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003052">But when Isa perceived unbelief on their part, he said Who will be my helpers in Allah's way? The disciples said: We are helpers (in the way) of Allah: We believe in Allah and bear witness that we are submitting ones.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003053">Our Lord! we believe in what Thou hast revealed and we follow the apostle, so write us down with those who bear witness.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003054">And they planned and Allah (also) planned, and Allah is the best of planners.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003055">And when Allah said: O Isa, I am going to terminate the period of your stay (on earth) and cause you to ascend unto Me and purify you of those who disbelieve and make those who follow you above those who disbelieve to the day of resurrection; then to Me shall be your return, so l will decide between you concerning that in which you differed.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003056">Then as to those who disbelieve, I will chastise them with severe chastisement in this world and the hereafter, and they shall have no helpers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003057">And as to those who believe and do good deeds, He will pay them fully their rewards; and Allah does not love the unjust.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003058">This We recite to you of the communications and the wise reminder.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003059">Surely the likeness of Isa is with Allah as the likeness of Adam; He created him from dust, then said to him, Be, and he was.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003060">(This is) the truth from your Lord, so be not of the disputers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003061">But whoever disputes with you in this matter after what has come to you of knowledge, then say: Come let us call our sons and your sons and our women and your women and our near people and your near people, then let us be earnest in prayer, and pray for the curse of Allah on the liars.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003062">Most surely this is the true explanation, and there is no god but Allah; and most surely Allah-- He is the Mighty, the Wise.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003063">But if they turn back, then surely Allah knows the mischief-makers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003064">Say: O followers of the Book! come to an equitable proposition between us and you that we shall not serve any but Allah and (that) we shall not associate aught with Him, and (that) some of us shall not take others for lords besides Allah; but if they turn back, then say: Bear witness that we are Muslims.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003065">O followers of the Book! why do you dispute about Ibrahim, when the Taurat and the Injeel were not revealed till after him; do you not then understand?</AYA>
		<AYA id="003066">Behold! you are they who disputed about that of which you had knowledge; why then do you dispute about that of which you have no knowledge? And Allah knows while you do not know.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003067">Ibrahim was not a Jew nor a Christian but he was (an) upright (man), a Muslim, and he was not one of the polytheists.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003068">Most surely the nearest of people to Ibrahim are those who followed him and this Prophet and those who believe and Allah is the guardian of the believers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003069">A party of the followers of the Book desire that they should lead you astray, and they lead not astray but themselves, and they do not perceive.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003070">O followers of the Book! Why do you disbelieve in the communications of Allah while you witness (them)?</AYA>
		<AYA id="003071">O followers of the Book! Why do you confound the truth with the falsehood and hide the truth while you know?</AYA>
		<AYA id="003072">And a party of the followers of the Book say: Avow belief in that which has been revealed to those who believe, in the first part of the day, and disbelieve at the end of it, perhaps they go back on their religion.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003073">And do not believe but in him who follows your religion. Say: Surely the (true) guidance is the guidance of Allah-- that one may be given (by Him) the like of what you were given; or they would contend with you by an argument before your Lord. Say: Surely grace is in the hand of Allah, He gives it to whom He pleases; and Allah is Ample-giving, Knowing.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003074">He specially chooses for His mercy whom He pleases; and Allah is the Lord of mighty grace.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003075">And among the followers of the Book there are some such that if you entrust one (of them) with a heap of wealth, he shall pay it back to you; and among them there are some such that if you entrust one (of them) with a dinar he shall not pay it back to you except so long as you remain firm in demanding it; this is because they say: There is not upon us in the matter of the unlearned people any way (to reproach); and they tell a lie against Allah while they know.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003076">Yea, whoever fulfills his promise and guards (against evil)-- then surely Allah loves those who guard (against evil).</AYA>
		<AYA id="003077">(As for) those who take a small price for the covenant of Allah and their own oaths-- surely they shall have no portion in the hereafter, and Allah will not speak to them, nor will He look upon them on the day of resurrection nor will He purify them, and they shall have a painful chastisement.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003078">Most surely there is a party amongst those who distort the Book with their tongue that you may consider it to be (a part) of the Book, and they say, It is from Allah, while it is not from Allah, and they tell a lie against Allah whilst they know.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003079">It is not meet for a mortal that Allah should give him the Book and the wisdom and prophethood, then he should say to men: Be my servants rather than Allah's; but rather (he would say): Be worshippers of the Lord because of your teaching the Book and your reading (it yourselves).</AYA>
		<AYA id="003080">And neither would he enjoin you that you should take the angels and the prophets for lords; what! would he enjoin you with unbelief after you are Muslims?</AYA>
		<AYA id="003081">And when Allah made a covenant through the prophets: Certainly what I have given you of Book and wisdom-- then an apostle comes to you verifying that which is with you, you must believe in him, and you must aid him. He said: Do you affirm and accept My compact in this (matter)? They said: We do affirm. He said: Then bear witness, and I (too) am of the bearers of witness with you.</AYA>

		<AYA id="003083">Is it then other than Allah's religion that they seek (to follow), and to Him submits whoever is in the heavens and the earth, willingly or unwillingly, and to Him shall they be returned.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003084">Say: We believe in Allah and what has been revealed to us, and what was revealed to Ibrahim and Ismail and Ishaq and Yaqoub and the tribes, and what was given to Musa and Isa and to the prophets from their Lord; we do not make any distinction between any of them, and to Him do we submit.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003085">And whoever desires a religion other than Islam, it shall not be accepted from him, and in the hereafter he shall be one of the losers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003086">How shall Allah guide a people who disbelieved after their believing and (after) they had borne witness that the Apostle was true and clear arguments had come to them; and Allah does not guide the unjust people.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003087">(As for) these, their reward is that upon them is the curse of Allah and the angels and of men, all together.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003088">Abiding in it; their chastisement shall not be lightened nor shall they be respited.</AYA>

		<AYA id="003091">Surely, those who disbelieve and die while they are unbelievers, the earth full of gold shall not be accepted from one of them, though he should offer to ransom himself with it, these it is who shall have a painful chastisement, and they shall have no helpers.</AYA>

		<AYA id="003113">They are not all alike; of the followers of the Book there is an upright party; they recite Allah's communications in the nighttime and they adore (Him).</AYA>
		<AYA id="003114">They believe in Allah and the last day, and they enjoin what is right and forbid the wrong and they strive with one another in hastening to good deeds, and those are among the good.</AYA>

		<AYA id="003118">O you who believe! do not take for intimate friends from among others than your own people; they do not fall short of inflicting loss upon you; they love what distresses you; vehement hatred has already appeared from out of their mouths, and what their breasts conceal is greater still; indeed, We have made the communications clear to you, if you will understand.</AYA>

		<AYA id="003120">If good befalls you, it grieves them, and if an evil afflicts you, they rejoice at it; and if you are patient and guard yourselves, their scheme will not injure you in any way; surely Allah comprehends what they do.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003121">And when you did go forth early in the morning from your family to lodge the believers in encampments for war and Allah is Hearing, Knowing.</AYA>

		<AYA id="003136">(As for) these-- their reward is forgiveness from their Lord, and gardens beneath which rivers flow, to abide in them, and excellent is the reward of the laborers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003137">Indeed there have been examples before you; therefore travel in the earth and see what was the end of the rejecters.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003138">This is a clear statement for men, and a guidance and an admonition to those who guard (against evil).</AYA>
		<AYA id="003139">And be not infirm, and be not grieving, and you shall have the upper hand if you are believers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003140">If a wound has afflicted you (at Ohud), a wound like it has also afflicted the (unbelieving) people; and We bring these days to men by turns, and that Allah may know those who believe and take witnesses from among you; and Allah does not love the unjust.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003141">And that He may purge those who believe and deprive the unbelievers of blessings.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003142">Do you think that you will enter the garden while Allah has not yet known those who strive hard from among you, and (He has not) known the patient.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003143">And certainly you desired death before you met it, so indeed you have seen it and you look (at it)</AYA>
		<AYA id="003144">And Muhammad is no more than an apostle; the apostles have already passed away before him; if then he dies or is killed will you turn back upon your heels? And whoever turns back upon his heels!s, he will by no means do harm to Allah in the least and Allah will reward the grateful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003145">And a soul will not die but with the permission of Allah the term is fixed; and whoever desires the reward of this world, I shall give him of it, and whoever desires the reward of the hereafter I shall give him of it, and I will reward the grateful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003146">And how many a prophet has fought with whom were many worshippers of the Lord; so they did not become weak-hearted on account of what befell them in Allah's way, nor did they weaken, nor did they abase themselves; and Allah loves the patient.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003147">And their saying was no other than that they said: Our Lord! forgive us our faults and our extravagance in our affair and make firm our feet and help us against the unbelieving people.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003148">So Allah gave them the reward of this world and better reward of the hereafter and Allah loves those who do good (to others).</AYA>
		<AYA id="003149">O you who believe! if you obey those who disbelieve they will turn you back upon your heels, so you will turn back losers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003150">Nay! Allah is your Patron and He is the best of the helpers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003151">We will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve, because they set up with Allah that for which He has sent down no authority, and their abode is the fire, and evil is the abode of the unjust.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003152">And certainly Allah made good to you His promise when you slew them by His permission, until when you became weak-hearted and disputed about the affair and disobeyed after He had shown you that which you loved; of you were some who desired this world and of you were some who desired the hereafter; then He turned you away from them that He might try you; and He has certainly pardoned you, and Allah is Gracious to the believers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003153">When you ran off precipitately and did not wait for any one, and the Apostle was calling you from your rear, so He gave you another sorrow instead of (your) sorrow, so that you might not grieve at what had escaped you, nor (at) what befell you; and Allah is aware of what you do.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003154">Then after sorrow He sent down security upon you, a calm coming upon a party of you, and (there was) another party whom their own souls had rendered anxious; they entertained about Allah thoughts of ignorance quite unjustly, saying: We have no hand in the affair. Say: Surely the affair is wholly (in the hands) of Allah. They conceal within their souls what they would not reveal to you. They say: Had we any hand in the affair, we would not have been slain here. Say: Had you remained in your houses, those for whom slaughter was ordained would certainly have gone forth to the places where they would be slain, and that Allah might test what was in your breasts and that He might purge what was in your hearts; and Allah knows what is in the breasts.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003155">(As for) those of you who turned back on the day when the two armies met, only the Shaitan sought to cause them to make a slip on account of some deeds they had done, and certainly Allah has pardoned them; surely Allah is Forgiving, Forbearing.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003156">O you who believe! be not like those who disbelieve and say of their brethren when they travel in the earth or engage in fighting: Had they been with us, they would not have died and they would not have been slain; so Allah makes this to be an intense regret in their hearts; and Allah gives life and causes death and Allah sees what you do.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003157">And if you are slain in the way of Allah or you die, certainly forgiveness from Allah and mercy is better than what they amass.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003158">And if indeed you die or you are slain, certainly to Allah shall you be gathered together.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003159">Thus it is due to mercy from Allah that you deal with them gently, and had you been rough, hard hearted, they would certainly have dispersed from around you; pardon them therefore and ask pardon for them, and take counsel with them in the affair; so when you have decided, then place your trust in Allah; surely Allah loves those who trust.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003160">If Allah assists you, then there is none that can overcome you, and if He forsakes you, who is there then that can assist you after Him? And on Allah should the believers rely.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003161">And it is not attributable to a prophet that he should act unfaithfully; and he who acts unfaithfully shall bring that in respect of which he has acted unfaithfully on the day of resurrection; then shall every soul be paid back fully what it has earned, and they shall not be dealt with unjustly.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003162">Is then he who follows the pleasure of Allah like him who has made himself deserving of displeasure from Allah, and his abode is hell; and it is an evil destination.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003163">There are (varying) grades with Allah, and Allah sees what they do.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003164">Certainly Allah conferred a benefit upon the believers when He raised among them an Apostle from among themselves, reciting to them His communications and purifying them, and teaching them the Book and the wisdom, although before that they were surely in manifest error.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003165">What! when a misfortune befell you, and you had certainly afflicted (the unbelievers) with twice as much, you began to say: Whence is this? Say: It is from yourselves; surely Allah has power over all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003166">And what befell you on the day when the two armies met (at Ohud) was with Allah's knowledge, and that He might know the believers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003167">And that He might know the hypocrites; and it was said to them: Come, fight in Allah's way, or defend yourselves. They said: If we knew fighting, we would certainly have followed you. They were on that day much nearer to unbelief than to belief. They say with their mouths what is not in their hearts, and Allah best knows what they conceal.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003168">Those who said of their brethren whilst they (themselves) held back: Had they obeyed us, they would not have been killed. Say: Then avert death from yourselves if you speak the truth.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003169">And reckon not those who are killed in Allah's way as dead; nay, they are alive (and) are provided sustenance from their Lord;</AYA>
		<AYA id="003170">Rejoicing in what Allah has given them out of His grace and they rejoice for the sake of those who, (being left) behind them, have not yet joined them, that they shall have no fear, nor shall they grieve.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003171">They rejoice on account of favor from Allah and (His) grace, and that Allah will not waste the reward of the believers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003172">(As for) those who responded (at Ohud) to the call of Allah and the Apostle after the wound had befallen them, those among them who do good (to others) and guard (against evil)shall have a great reward.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003173">Those to whom the people said: Surely men have gathered against you, therefore fear them, but this increased their faith, and they said: Allah is sufficient for us and most excellent is the Protector.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003174">So they returned with favor from Allah and (His) grace, no evil touched them and they followed the pleasure of Allah; and Allah is the Lord of mighty grace.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003175">It is only the Shaitan that causes you to fear from his friends, but do not fear them, and fear Me if you are believers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003176">And let not those grieve you who fall into unbelief hastily; surely they can do no harm to Allah at all; Allah intends that He should not give them any portion in the hereafter, and they shall have a grievous chastisement.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003177">Surely those who have bought unbelief at the price of faith shall do no harm at all to Allah, and they shall have a painful chastisement.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003178">And let not those who disbelieve think that Our granting them respite is better for their souls; We grant them respite only that they may add to their sins; and they shall have a disgraceful chastisement.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003179">On no account will Allah leave the believers in the condition which you are in until He separates the evil from the good; nor is Allah going to make you acquainted with the unseen, but Allah chooses of His apostles whom He pleases; therefore believe in Allah and His apostles; and if you believe and guard (against evil), then you shall have a great reward.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003180">And let not those deem, who are niggardly in giving away that which Allah has granted them out of His grace, that it is good for them; nay, it is worse for them; they shall have that whereof they were niggardly made to cleave to their necks on the resurrection day; and Allah's is the heritage of the heavens and the earth; and Allah is aware of what you do.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003181">Allah has certainly heard the saying of those who said: Surely Allah is poor and we are rich. I will record what they say, and their killing the prophets unjustly, and I will say: Taste the chastisement of burning.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003182">This is for what your own hands have sent before and because Allah is not in the least unjust to the servants.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003183">(Those are they) who said: Surely Allah has enjoined us that we should not believe in any apostle until he brings us an offering which the fire consumes. Say: Indeed, there came to you apostles before me with clear arguments and with that which you demand; why then did you kill them if you are truthful?</AYA>
		<AYA id="003184">But if they reject you, so indeed were rejected before you apostles who came with clear arguments and scriptures and the illuminating book.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003185">Every soul shall taste of death, and you shall only be paid fully your reward on the resurrection day; then whoever is removed far away from the fire and is made to enter the garden he indeed has attained the object; and the life of this world is nothing but a provision of vanities.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003186">You shall certainly be tried respecting your wealth and your souls, and you shall certainly hear from those who have been given the Book before you and from those who are polytheists much annoying talk; and if you are patient and guard (against evil), surely this is one of the affairs (which should be) determined upon.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003187">And when Allah made a covenant with those who were given the Book: You shall certainly make it known to men and you shall not hide it; but they cast it behind their backs and took a small price for it; so evil is that which they buy.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003188">Do not think those who rejoice for what they have done and love that they should be praised for what they have not done-- so do by no means think them to be safe from the chastisement, and they shall have a painful chastisement.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003189">And Allah's is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and Allah has power over all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003190">Most surely in the creation of the heavens and the earth and the alternation of the night and the day there are signs for men who understand.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003191">Those who remember Allah standing and sitting and lying on their sides and reflect on the creation of the heavens and the earth: Our Lord! Thou hast not created this in vain! Glory be to Thee; save us then from the chastisement of the fire:</AYA>
		<AYA id="003192">Our Lord! surely whomsoever Thou makest enter the fire, him Thou hast indeed brought to disgrace, and there shall be no helpers for the unjust:</AYA>
		<AYA id="003193">Our Lord! surely we have heard a preacher calling to the faith, saying: Believe in your Lord, so we did believe; Our Lord! forgive us therefore our faults, and cover our evil deeds and make us die with the righteous.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003194">Our Lord! and grant us what Thou hast promised us by Thy apostles; and disgrace us not on the day of resurrection; surely Thou dost not fail to perform the promise.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003195">So their Lord accepted their prayer: That I will not waste the work of a worker among you, whether male or female, the one of you being from the other; they, therefore, who fled and were turned out of their homes and persecuted in My way and who fought and were slain, I will most certainly cover their evil deeds, and I will most certainly make them enter gardens beneath which rivers flow; a reward from Allah, and with Allah is yet better reward.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003196">Let it not deceive you that those who disbelieve go to and fro in the cities fearlessly.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003197">A brief enjoyment! then their abode is hell, and evil is the resting-place.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003198">But as to those who are careful of (their duty to) their Lord, they shall have gardens beneath which rivers flow, abiding in them; an entertainment from their Lord, and that which is with Allah is best for the righteous.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003199">And most surely of the followers of the Book there are those who believe in Allah and (in) that which has been revealed to you and (in) that which has been revealed to them, being lowly before Allah; they do not take a small price for the communications of Allah; these it is that have their reward with their Lord; surely Allah is quick in reckoning.</AYA>
		<AYA id="003200">O you who believe! be patient and excel in patience and remain steadfast, and be careful of (your duty to) Allah, that you may be successful.</AYA>
	</SOURA>


	<SOURA id="4" name="Women">
		<AYA id="004001">O people! be careful of (your duty to) your Lord, Who created you from a single being and created its mate of the same (kind) and spread from these two, many men and women; and be careful of (your duty to) Allah, by Whom you demand one of another (your rights), and (to) the ties of relationship; surely Allah ever watches over you.</AYA>
		<AYA id="004002">And give to the orphans their property, and do not substitute worthless (things) for (their) good (ones), and do not devour their property (as an addition) to your own property; this is surely a great crime.</AYA>
		<AYA id="004003">And if you fear that you cannot act equitably towards orphans, then marry such women as seem good to you, two and three and four; but if you fear that you will not do justice (between them), then (marry) only one or what your right hands possess; this is more proper, that you may not deviate from the right course.</AYA>
		<AYA id="004004">And give women their dowries as a free gift, but if they of themselves be pleased to give up to you a portion of it, then eat it with enjoyment and with wholesome result.</AYA>
		<AYA id="004005">And do not give away your property which Allah has made for you a (means of) support to the weak of understanding, and maintain them out of (the profits of) it, and clothe them and speak to them words of honest advice.</AYA>
		<AYA id="004006">And test the orphans until they attain puberty; then if you find in them maturity of intellect, make over to them their property, and do not consume it extravagantly and hastily, lest they attain to full age; and whoever is rich, let him abstain altogether, and whoever is poor, let him eat reasonably; then when you make over to them their property, call witnesses in their presence; and Allah is enough as a Reckoner.</AYA>
		<AYA id="004007">Men shall have a portion of what the parents and the near relatives leave, and women shall have a portion of what the parents and the near relatives leave, whether there is little or much of it; a stated portion.</AYA>
		<AYA id="004008">And when there are present at the division the relatives and the orphans and the needy, give them (something) out of it and speak to them kind words.</AYA>
		<AYA id="004009">And let those fear who, should they leave behind them weakly offspring, would fear on their account, so let them be careful of (their duty to) Allah, and let them speak right words.</AYA>

		<AYA id="005001">O you who believe! fulfill the obligations. The cattle quadrupeds are allowed to you except that which is recited to you, not violating the prohibition against game when you are entering upon the performance of the pilgrimage; surely Allah orders what He desires.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005002">O you who believe! do not violate the signs appointed by Allah nor the sacred month, nor (interfere with) the offerings, nor the sacrificial animals with garlands, nor those going to the sacred house seeking the grace and pleasure of their Lord; and when you are free from the obligations of the pilgrimage, then hunt, and let not hatred of a people-- because they hindered you from the Sacred Masjid-- incite you to exceed the limits, and help one another in goodness and piety, and do not help one another in sin and aggression; and be careful of (your duty to) Allah; surely Allah is severe in requiting (evil).</AYA>
		<AYA id="005003">Forbidden to you is that which dies of itself, and blood, and flesh of swine, and that on which any other name than that of Allah has been invoked, and the strangled (animal) and that beaten to death, and that killed by a fall and that killed by being smitten with the horn, and that which wild beasts have eaten, except what you slaughter, and what is sacrificed on stones set up (for idols) and that you divide by the arrows; that is a transgression. This day have those who disbelieve despaired of your religion, so fear them not, and fear Me. This day have I perfected for you your religion and completed My favor on you and chosen for you Islam as a religion; but whoever is compelled by hunger, not inclining willfully to sin, then surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005004">They ask you as to what is allowed to them. Say: The good things are allowed to you, and what you have taught the beasts and birds of prey, training them to hunt-- you teach them of what Allah has taught you-- so eat of that which they catch for you and mention the name of Allah over it; and be careful of (your duty to) Allah; surely Allah is swift in reckoning.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005005">This day (all) the good things are allowed to you; and the food of those who have been given the Book is lawful for you and your food is lawful for them; and the chaste from among the believing women and the chaste from among those who have been given the Book before you (are lawful for you); when you have given them their dowries, taking (them) in marriage, not fornicating nor taking them for paramours in secret; and whoever denies faith, his work indeed is of no account, and in the hereafter he shall be one of the losers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005006">O you who believe! when you rise up to prayer, wash your faces and your hands as far as the elbows, and wipe your heads and your feet to the ankles; and if you are under an obligation to perform a total ablution, then wash (yourselves) and if you are sick or on a journey, or one of you come from the privy, or you have touched the women, and you cannot find water, betake yourselves to pure earth and wipe your faces and your hands therewith, Allah does not desire to put on you any difficulty, but He wishes to purify you and that He may complete His favor on you, so that you may be grateful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005007">And remember the favor of Allah on you and His covenant with which He bound you firmly, when you said: We have heard and we obey, and be careful of (your duty to) Allah, surely Allah knows what is in the breasts.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005008">O you who believe! Be upright for Allah, bearers of witness with justice, and let not hatred of a people incite you not to act equitably; act equitably, that is nearer to piety, and he careful of (your duty to) Allah; surely Allah is Aware of what you do.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005009">Allah has promised to those who believe and do good deeds (that) they shall have forgiveness and a mighty reward.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005010">And (as for) those who disbelieve and reject our communications, these are the companions of the name.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005011">O you who believe! remember Allah's favor on you when a people had determined to stretch forth their hands towards you, but He withheld their hands from you, and be careful of (your duty to) Allah; and on Allah let the believers rely.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005012">And certainly Allah made a covenant with the children of Israel, and We raised up among them twelve chieftains; and Allah said: Surely I am with you; if you keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate and believe in My apostles and asslst them and offer to Allah a goodly gift, I will most certainly cover your evil deeds, and I will most certainly cause you to enter into gardens beneath which rivers flow, but whoever disbelieves from among you after that, he indeed shall lose the right way.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005013">But on account of their breaking their covenant We cursed them and made their hearts hard; they altered the words from their places and they neglected a portion of what they were reminded of; and you shall always discover treachery in them excepting a few of them; so pardon them and turn away; surely Allah loves those who do good (to others).</AYA>
		<AYA id="005014">And with those who say, We are Christians, We made a covenant, but they neglected a portion of what they were reminded of, therefore We excited among them enmity and hatred to the day of resurrection; and Allah will inform them of what they did.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005015">O followers of the Book! indeed Our Apostle has come to you making clear to you much of what you concealed of the Book and passing over much; indeed, there has come to you light and a clear Book from Allah;</AYA>
		<AYA id="005016">With it Allah guides him who will follow His pleasure into the ways of safety and brings them out of utter darkness into light by His will and guides them to the right path.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005017">Certainly they disbelieve who say: Surely, Allah-- He is the Messiah, son of Marium. Say: Who then could control anything as against Allah when He wished to destroy the Messiah son of Marium and his mother and all those on the earth? And Allah's is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and what is between them; He creates what He pleases; and Allah has power over all things,</AYA>
		<AYA id="005018">And the Jews and the Christians say: We are the sons of Allah and His beloved ones. Say: Why does He then chastise you for your faults? Nay, you are mortals from among those whom He has created, He forgives whom He pleases and chastises whom He pleases; and Allah's is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and what is between them, and to Him is the eventual coming.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005019">O followers of the Book! indeed Our Apostle has come to you explaining to you after a cessation of the (mission of the) apostles, lest you say: There came not to us a giver of good news or a warner, so indeed there has come to you a giver of good news and a warner; and Allah has power over all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005020">And when Musa said to his people: O my people! remember the favor of Allah upon you when He raised prophets among you and made you kings and gave you what He had not given to any other among the nations.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005021">O my people! enter the holy land which Allah has prescribed for you and turn not on your backs for then you will turn back losers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005022">They said: O Musa! surely there is a strong race in it, and we will on no account enter it until they go out from it, so if they go out from it, then surely we will enter.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005023">Two men of those who feared, upon both of whom Allah had bestowed a favor, said: Enter upon them by the gate, for when you have entered it you shall surely be victorious, and on Allah should you rely if you are believers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005024">They said: O Musa! we shall never enter it so long as they are in it; go therefore you and your Lord, then fight you both surely we will here sit down.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005025">He said: My Lord! Surely I have no control (upon any) but my own self and my brother; therefore make a separation between us and the nation of transgressors.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005026">He said: So it shall surely be forbidden to them for forty years, they shall wander about in the land, therefore do not grieve for the nation of transgressors.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005027">And relate to them the story of the two sons of Adam with truth when they both offered an offering, but it was accepted from one of them and was not accepted from the other. He said: I I will most certainly slay you. (The other) said: Allah only accepts from those who guard (against evil).</AYA>
		<AYA id="005028">If you will stretch forth your hand towards me to slay me, I am not one to stretch forth my hand towards you to slay you surely I fear Allah, the Lord of the worlds:</AYA>
		<AYA id="005029">Surely I wish that you should bear the sin committed against me and your own sin, and so you would be of the inmates of the fire, and this is the recompense of the unjust.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005030">Then his mind facilitated to him the slaying of his brother so he slew him; then he became one of the losers</AYA>
		<AYA id="005031">Then Allah sent a crow digging up the earth so that he might show him how he should cover the dead body of his brother. He said: Woe me! do I lack the strength that I should be like this crow and cover the dead body of my brother? So he became of those who regret.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005032">For this reason did We prescribe to the children of Israel that whoever slays a soul, unless it be for manslaughter or for mischief in the land, it is as though he slew all men; and whoever keeps it alive, it is as though he kept alive all men; and certainly Our apostles came to them with clear arguments, but even after that many of them certainly act extravagantly in the land.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005033">The punishment of those who wage war against Allah and His apostle and strive to make mischief in the land is only this, that they should be murdered or crucified or their hands and their feet should be cut off on opposite sides or they should be imprisoned; this shall be as a disgrace for them in this world, and in the hereafter they shall have a grievous chastisement,</AYA>
		<AYA id="005034">Except those who repent before you have them in your power; so know that Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005035">O you who believe! be careful of (your duty to) Allah and seek means of nearness to Him and strive hard in His way that you may be successful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005036">Surely (as for) those who disbelieve, even if they had what is in the earth, all of it, and the like of it with it, that they might ransom themselves with it from the punishment of the day of resurrection, it shall not be accepted from them, and they shall have a painful punishment.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005037">They would desire to go forth from the fire, and they shall not go forth from it, and they shall have a lasting punishment.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005038">And (as for) the man who steals and the woman who steals, cut off their hands as a punishment for what they have earned, an exemplary punishment from Allah; and Allah is Mighty, Wise.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005039">But whoever repents after his iniquity and reforms (himself), then surely Allah will turn to him (mercifully); surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005040">Do you not know that Allah-- His is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth; He chastises whom He pleases; and forgives whom He pleases and Allah has power over all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005041">O Apostle! let not those grieve you who strive together in hastening to unbelief from among those who say with their mouths: We believe, and their hearts do not believe, and from among those who are Jews; they are listeners for the sake of a lie, listeners for another people who have not come to you; they alter the words from their places, saying: If you are given this, take it, and if you are not given this, be cautious; and as for him whose temptation Allah desires, you cannot control anything for him with Allah. Those are they for whom Allah does not desire that He should purify their hearts; they shall have disgrace in this world, and they shall have a grievous chastisement in the hereafter.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005042">(They are) listeners of a lie, devourers of what is forbidden; therefore if they come to you, judge between them or turn aside from them, and if you turn aside from them, they shall not harm you in any way; and if you judge, judge between them with equity; surely Allah loves those who judge equitably.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005043">And how do they make you a judge and they have the Taurat wherein is Allah's judgment? Yet they turn back after that, and these are not the believers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005044">Surely We revealed the Taurat in which was guidance and light; with it the prophets who submitted themselves (to Allah) judged (matters) for those who were Jews, and the masters of Divine knowledge and the doctors, because they were required to guard (part) of the Book of Allah, and they were witnesses thereof; therefore fear not the people and fear Me, and do not take a small price for My communications; and whoever did not judge by what Allah revealed, those are they that are the unbelievers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005045">And We prescribed to them in it that life is for life, and eye for eye, and nose for nose, and ear for ear, and tooth for tooth, and (that there is) reprisal in wounds; but he who foregoes it, it shall be an expiation for him; and whoever did not judge by what Allah revealed, those are they that are the unjust.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005046">And We sent after them in their footsteps Isa, son of Marium, verifying what was before him of the Taurat and We gave him the Injeel in which was guidance and light, and verifying what was before it of Taurat and a guidance and an admonition for those who guard (against evil).</AYA>
		<AYA id="005047">And the followers of the Injeel should have judged by what Allah revealed in it; and whoever did not judge by what Allah revealed, those are they that are the transgressors.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005048">And We have revealed to you the Book with the truth, verifying what is before it of the Book and a guardian over it, therefore judge between them by what Allah has revealed, and do not follow their low desires (to turn away) from the truth that has come to you; for every one of you did We appoint a law and a way, and if Allah had pleased He would have made you (all) a single people, but that He might try you in what He gave you, therefore strive with one another to hasten to virtuous deeds; to Allah is your return, of all (of you), so He will let you know that in which you differed;</AYA>
		<AYA id="005049">And that you should judge between them by what Allah has revealed, and do not follow their low desires, and be cautious of them, lest they seduce you from part of what Allah has revealed to you; but if they turn back, then know that Allah desires to afflict them on account of some of their faults; and most surely many of the people are transgressors.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005050">Is it then the judgment of (the times of) ignorance that they desire? And who is better than Allah to judge for a people who are sure?</AYA>
		<AYA id="005051">O you who believe! do not take the Jews and the Christians for friends; they are friends of each other; and whoever amongst you takes them for a friend, then surely he is one of them; surely Allah does not guide the unjust people.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005052">But you will see those in whose hearts is a disease hastening towards them, saying: We fear lest a calamity should befall us; but it may be that Allah will bring the victory or a punish ment from Himself, so that they shall be regretting on account of what they hid in their souls.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005053">And those who believe will say: Are these they who swore by Allah with the most forcible of their oaths that they were most surely with you? Their deeds shall go for nothing, so they shall become losers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005054">O you who believe! whoever from among you turns back from his religion, then Allah will bring a people, He shall love them and they shall love Him, lowly before the believers, mighty against the unbelievers, they shall strive hard in Allah's way and shall not fear the censure of any censurer; this is Allah's Face, He gives it to whom He pleases, and Allah is Ample-giving, Knowing.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005055">Only Allah is your Vali and His Apostle and those who believe, those who keep up prayers and pay the poor-rate while they bow.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005056">And whoever takes Allah and His apostle and those who believe for a guardian, then surely the party of Allah are they that shall be triumphant.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005057">O you who believe! do not take for guardians those who take your religion for a mockery and a joke, from among those who were given the Book before you and the unbelievers; and be careful of (your duty to) Allah if you are believers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005058">And when you call to prayer they make it a mockery and a joke; this is because they are a people who do not understand.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005059">Say: O followers of the Book! do you find fault with us (for aught) except that we believe in Allah and in what has been revealed to us and what was revealed before, and that most of you are transgressors?</AYA>
		<AYA id="005060">Say: Shall I inform you of (him who is) worse than this in retribution from Allah? (Worse is he) whom Allah has cursed and brought His wrath upon, and of whom He made apes and swine, and he who served the Shaitan; these are worse in place and more erring from the straight path.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005061">And when they come to you, they say: We believe; and indeed they come in with unbelief and indeed they go forth with it; and Allah knows best what they concealed.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005062">And you will see many of them striving with one another to hasten in sin and exceeding the limits, and their eating of what is unlawfully acquired; certainly evil is that which they do.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005063">Why do not the learned men and the doctors of law prohibit them from their speaking of what is sinful and their eating of what is unlawfully acquired? Certainly evil is that which they work.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005064">And the Jews say: The hand of Allah is tied up! Their hands shall be shackled and they shall be cursed for what they say. Nay, both His hands are spread out, He expends as He pleases; and what has been revealed to you from your Lord will certainly make many of them increase in inordinacy and unbelief; and We have put enmity and hatred among them till the day of resurrection; whenever they kindle a fire for war Allah puts it out, and they strive to make mischief in the land; and Allah does not love the mischief-makers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005065">And if the followers of the Book had believed and guarded (against evil) We would certainly have covered their evil deeds and We would certainly have made them enter gardens of bliss</AYA>
		<AYA id="005066">And if they had kept up the Taurat and the Injeel and that which was revealed to them from their Lord, they would certainly have eaten from above them and from beneath their feet there is a party of them keeping to the moderate course, and (as for) most of them, evil is that which they do</AYA>
		<AYA id="005067">O Apostle! deliver what has been revealed to you from your Lord; and if you do it not, then you have not delivered His message, and Allah will protect you from the people; surely Allah will not guide the unbelieving people.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005068">Say: O followers of the Book! you follow no good till you keep up the Taurat and the Injeel and that which is revealed to you from your Lord; and surely that which has been revealed to you from your Lord shall make many of them increase in inordinacy and unbelief; grieve not therefore for the unbelieving people.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005069">Surely those who believe and those who are Jews and the Sabians and the Christians whoever believes in Allah and the last day and does good-- they shall have no fear nor shall they grieve.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005070">Certainly We made a covenant with the children of Israel and We sent to them apostles; whenever there came to them an apostle with what that their souls did not desire, some (of them) did they call liars and some they slew.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005071">And they thought that there would be no affliction, so they became blind and deaf; then Allah turned to them mercifully, but many of them became blind and deaf; and Allah is well seeing what they do.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005072">Certainly they disbelieve who say: Surely Allah, He is the Messiah, son of Marium; and the Messiah said: O Children of Israel! serve Allah, my Lord and your Lord. Surely whoever associates (others) with Allah, then Allah has forbidden to him the garden, and his abode is the fire; and there shall be no helpers for the unjust.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005073">Certainly they disbelieve who say: Surely Allah is the third (person) of the three; and there is no god but the one God, and if they desist not from what they say, a painful chastisement shall befall those among them who disbelieve.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005074">Will they not then turn to Allah and ask His forgiveness? And Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005075">The Messiah, son of Marium is but an apostle; apostles before him have indeed passed away; and his mother was a truthful woman; they both used to eat food. See how We make the communications clear to them, then behold, how they are turned away.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005076">Say: Do you serve besides Allah that which does not control for you any harm, or any profit? And Allah-- He is the Hearing, the Knowing.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005077">Say: O followers of the Book! be not unduly immoderate in your religion, and do not follow the low desires of people who went astray before and led many astray and went astray from the right path.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005078">Those who disbelieved from among the children of Israel were cursed by the tongue of Dawood and Isa, son of Marium; this was because they disobeyed and used to exceed the limit.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005079">They used not to forbid each other the hateful things (which) they did; certainly evil was that which they did.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005080">You will see many of them befriending those who disbelieve; certainly evil is that which their souls have sent before for them, that Allah became displeased with them and in chastisement shall they abide.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005081">And had they believed in Allah and the prophet and what was revealed to him, they would not have taken them for friends but! most of them are transgressors.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005082">Certainly you will find the most violent of people in enmity for those who believe (to be) the Jews and those who are polytheists, and you will certainly find the nearest in friendship to those who believe (to be) those who say: We are Christians; this is because there are priests and monks among them and because they do not behave proudly.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005083">And when they hear what has been revealed to the apostle you will see their eyes overflowing with tears on account of the truth that they recognize; they say: Our Lord! we believe, so write us down with the witnesses (of truth).</AYA>
		<AYA id="005084">And what (reason) have we that we should not believe in Allah and in the truth that has come to us, while we earnestly desire that our Lord should cause us to enter with the good people?</AYA>
		<AYA id="005085">Therefore Allah rewarded them on account of what they said, with gardens in which rivers flow to abide in them; and this is the reward of those who do good (to others).</AYA>
		<AYA id="005086">And (as for) those who disbelieve and reject Our communications, these are the companions of the flame.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005087">O you who believe! do not forbid (yourselves) the good things which Allah has made lawful for you and do not exceed the limits; surely Allah does not love those who exceed the limits.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005088">And eat of the lawful and good (things) that Allah has given you, and be careful of (your duty to) Allah, in Whom you believe.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005089">Allah does not call you to account for what is vain in your oaths, but He calls you to account for the making of deliberate oaths; so its expiation is the feeding of ten poor men out of the middling (food) you feed your families with, or their clothing, or the freeing of a neck; but whosoever cannot find (means) then fasting for three days; this is the expiation of your oaths when you swear; and guard your oaths. Thus does Allah make clear to you His communications, that you may be Fateful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005090">O you who believe! intoxicants and games of chance and (sacrificing to) stones set up and (dividing by) arrows are only an uncleanness, the Shaitan's work; shun it therefore that you may be successful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005091">The Shaitan only desires to cause enmity and hatred to spring in your midst by means of intoxicants and games of chance, and to keep you off from the remembrance of Allah and from prayer. Will you then desist?</AYA>
		<AYA id="005092">And obey Allah and obey the apostle and be cautious; but if you turn back, then know that only a clear deliverance of the message is (incumbent) on Our apostle.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005093">On those who believe and do good there is no blame for what they eat, when they are careful (of their duty) and believe and do good deeds, then they are careful (of their duty) and believe, then they are careful (of their duty) and do good (to others), and Allah loves those who do good (to others).</AYA>
		<AYA id="005094">O you who believe! Allah will certainly try you in respect of some game which your hands and your lances can reach, that Allah might know who fears Him in secret; but whoever exceeds the limit after this, he shall have a painful punishment.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005095">O you who believe! do not kill game while you are on pilgrimage, and whoever among you shall kill it intentionally, the compensation (of it) is the like of what he killed, from the cattle, as two just persons among you shall judge, as an offering to be brought to the Kaaba or the expiation (of it) is the feeding of the poor or the equivalent of it in fasting, that he may taste the unwholesome result of his deed; Allah has pardoned what is gone by; and whoever returns (to it), Allah will inflict retribution on him; and Allah is Mighty, Lord of Retribution.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005096">Lawful to you is the game of the sea and its food, a provision for you and for the travellers, and the game of the land is forbidden to you so long as you are on pilgrimage, and be careful of (your duty to) Allah, to Whom you shall be gathered.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005097">Allah has made the Kaaba, the sacred house, a maintenance for the people, and the sacred month and the offerings and the sacrificial animals with garlands; this is that you may know that Allah knows whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth, and that Allah is the Knower of all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005098">Know that Allah is severe in requiting (evil) and that Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005099">Nothing is (incumbent) on the Apostle but to deliver (the message), and Allah knows what you do openly and what you hide.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005100">Say: The bad and the good are not equal, though the abundance of the bad may please you; so be careful of (your duty to) Allah, O men of understanding, that you may be successful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005101">O you who believe! do not put questions about things which if declared to you may trouble you, and if you question about them when the Quran is being revealed, they shall be declared to you; Allah pardons this, and Allah is Forgiving, Forbearing.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005102">A people before you indeed asked such questions, and then became disbelievers on account of them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005103">Allah has not ordained (the making of) a bahirah or a saibah or a wasilah or a hami but those who disbelieve fabricate a lie against Allah, and most of them do not understand.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005104">And when it is said to them, Come to what Allah has revealed and to the Apostle, they say: That on which we found our fathers is sufficient for us. What! even though their fathers knew nothing and did not follow the right way.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005105">O you who believe! take care of your souls; he who errs cannot hurt you when you are on the right way; to Allah is your return, of all (of you), so He will inform you of what you did.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005106">O you who believe! call to witness between you when death draws nigh to one of you, at the time of making the will, two just persons from among you, or two others from among others than you, if you are travelling in the land and the calamity of death befalls you; the two (witnesses) you should detain after the prayer; then if you doubt (them), they shall both swear by Allah, (saying): We will not take for it a price, though there be a relative, and we will not hide the testimony of Allah for then certainly we should be among the sinners.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005107">Then if it becomes known that they both have been guilty of a sin, two others shall stand up in their place from among those who have a claim against them, the two nearest in kin; so they two should swear by Allah: Certainly our testimony is truer than the testimony of those two, and we have not exceeded the limit, for then most surely we should be of the unjust.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005108">This is more proper in order that they should give testimony truly or fear that other oaths be given after their oaths; and be careful of (your duty to) Allah, and hear; and Allah does not guide the transgressing people.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005109">On the day when Allah will assemble the apostles, then say: What answer were you given? They shall say: We have no knowledge, surely Thou art the great Knower of the unseen things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005110">When Allah will say: O Isa son of Marium! Remember My favor on you and on your mother, when I strengthened you I with the holy Spirit, you spoke to the people in the cradle and I when of old age, and when I taught you the Book and the wisdom and the Taurat and the Injeel; and when you determined out of clay a thing like the form of a bird by My permission, then you breathed into it and it became a bird by My permission, and you healed the blind and the leprous by My permission; and when you brought forth the dead by My permission; and when I withheld the children of Israel from you when you came to them with clear arguments, but those who disbelieved among them said: This is nothing but clear enchantment.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005111">And when I revealed to the disciples, saying, Believe in Me and My apostle, they said: We believe and bear witness that we submit (ourselves).</AYA>
		<AYA id="005112">When the disciples said: O Isa son of Marium! will your Lord consent to send down to us food from heaven? He said: Be careful of (your duty to) Allah if you are believers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005113">They said: We desire that we should eat of it and that our hearts should be at rest, and that we may know that you have indeed spoken the truth to us and that we may be of the witnesses to it.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005114">Isa the son of Marium said: O Allah, our Lord! send i down to us food from heaven which should be to us an ever-recurring happiness, to the first of us and to the last of us, and a sign from Thee, and grant us means of subsistence, and Thou art the best of the Providers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005115">Allah said: Surely I will send it down to you, but whoever shall disbelieve afterwards from among you, surely I will chastise him with a chastisement with which I will not chastise, anyone among the nations.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005116">And when Allah will say: O Isa son of Marium! did you say to men, Take me and my mother for two gods besides Allah he will say: Glory be to Thee, it did not befit me that I should say what I had no right to (say); if I had said it, Thou wouldst indeed have known it; Thou knowest what is in my mind, and I do not know what is in Thy mind, surely Thou art the great Knower of the unseen things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005117">1 did not say to them aught save what Thou didst enjoin me with: That serve Allah, my Lord and your Lord, and I was a witness of them so long as I was among them, but when Thou didst cause me to die, Thou wert the watcher over them, and Thou art witness of all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005118">If Thou shouldst chastise them, then surely they are Thy servants; and if Thou shouldst forgive them, then surely Thou art the Mighty, the Wise.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005119">Allah will say: This is the day when their truth shall benefit the truthful ones; they shall have gardens beneath which rivers flow to abide in them for ever: Allah is well pleased with them and they are well pleased with Allah; this is the mighty achievement.</AYA>
		<AYA id="005120">Allah's is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and what is in them; and He has power over all things.</AYA>

	<SOURA id="6" name="The Cattle">
		<AYA id="006001">All praise is due to Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth and made the darkness and the light; yet those who disbelieve set up equals with their Lord.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006002">He it is Who created you from clay, then He decreed a term; and there is a term named with Him; still you doubt.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006003">And He is Allah in the heavens and in the earth; He knows your secret (thoughts) and your open (words), and He knows what you earn.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006004">And there does not come to them any communication of the communications of their Lord but they turn aside from it</AYA>
		<AYA id="006005">So they have indeed rejected the truth when it came to them; therefore the truth of what they mocked at will shine upon them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006006">Do they not consider how many a generation We have destroyed before them, whom We had established in the earth as We have not established you, and We sent the clouds pouring rain on them in abundance, and We made the rivers to flow beneath them, then We destroyed them on account of their faults and raised up after them another generation.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006007">And if We had sent to you a writing on a paper, then they had touched it with their hands, certainly those who disbelieve would have said: This is nothing but clear enchantment.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006008">And they say: Why has not an angel been sent down to him? And had We sent down an angel, the matter would have certainly been decided and then they would not have been respited.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006009">And if We had made him angel, We would certainly have made him a man, and We would certainly have made confused to them what they make confused.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006010">And certainly apostles before you were mocked at, but that which they mocked at encompassed the scoffers among them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006011">Say: Travel in the land, then see what was the end of the rejecters.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006012">Say: To whom belongs what is in the heavens and the earth? Say: To Allah; He has ordained mercy on Himself; most certainly He will gather you on the resurrection day-- there is no doubt about it. (As for) those who have lost their souls, they will not believe.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006013">And to Him belongs whatever dwells in the night and the day; and He is the Hearing, the Knowing.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006014">Say: Shall I take a guardian besides Allah, the Originator of the heavens and the earth, and He feeds (others) and is not (Himself) fed. Say: I am commanded to be the first who submits himself, and you should not be of the polytheists.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006015">Say: Surely I fear, if I disobey my Lord, the chastisement of a grievous day</AYA>
		<AYA id="006016">He from whom it is averted on that day, Allah indeed has shown mercy to him; and this is a manifest achievement.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006017">And if Allah touch you with affliction, there is none to take it off but He; and if He visit you with good, then He has power over all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006018">And He is the Supreme, above His servants; and He is the Wise, the Aware.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006019">Say: What thing is the weightiest in testimony? Say: Allah is witness between you and me; and this Quran has been revealed to me that with it I may warn you and whomsoever it reaches. Do you really bear witness that there are other gods with Allah? Say: I do not bear witness. Say: He is only one God, and surely I am clear of that which you set up (with Him).</AYA>
		<AYA id="006020">Those whom We have given the Book recognize him as they recognize their sons; (as for) those who have lost their souls, they will not believe.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006021">And who is more unjust than he who forges a lie against Allah or (he who) gives the lie to His communications; surely the unjust will not be successful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006022">And on the day when We shall gather them all together, then shall We say to those who associated others (with Allah): Where are your associates whom you asserted?</AYA>
		<AYA id="006023">Then their excuse would be nothing but that they would say: By Allah, our Lord, we were not polytheists.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006024">See how they lie against their own souls, and that which they forged has passed away from them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006025">And of them is he who hearkens to you, and We have cast veils over their hearts lest they understand it and a heaviness into their ears; and even if they see every sign they will not believe in it; so much so that when they come to you they only dispute with you; those who disbelieve say: This is naught but the stories of the ancients.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006026">And they prohibit (others) from it and go far away from it, and they only bring destruction upon their own souls while they do not perceive.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006027">And could you see when they are made to stand before the fire, then they shall say: Would that we were sent back, and we would not reject the communications of our Lord and we would be of the believers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006028">Nay, what they concealed before shall become manifest to them; and if they were sent back, they would certainly go back to that which they are forbidden, and most surely they are liars.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006029">And they say: There is nothing but our life of this world, and we shall not be raised.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006030">And could you see when they are made to stand before their Lord. He will say: Is not this the truth? They will say: Yea! by our Lord. He will say: Taste then the chastisement because you disbelieved.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006031">They are losers indeed who reject the meeting of Allah; until when the hour comes upon them all of a sudden they shall say: O our grief for our neglecting it! and they shall bear their burdens on their backs; now surely evil is that which they bear.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006032">And this world's life is naught but a play and an idle sport and certainly the abode of the hereafter is better for those who guard (against evil); do you not then understand?</AYA>
		<AYA id="006033">We know indeed that what they say certainly grieves you, but surely they do not call you a liar; but the unjust deny the communications of Allah.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006034">And certainly apostles before you were rejected, but they were patient on being rejected and persecuted until Our help came to them; and there is none to change the words of Allah, and certainly there has come to you some information about the messengers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006035">And if their turning away is hard on you, then if you can seek an opening (to go down) into the earth or a ladder (to ascend up) to heaven so that you should bring them a sign and if Allah had pleased He would certainly have gathered them all on guidance, therefore be not of the ignorant.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006036">Only those accept who listen; and (as to) the dead, Allah will raise them, then to Him they shall be returned.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006037">And they say: Why has not a sign been sent down to him from his Lord? Say: Surely Allah is able to send down a sign, but most of them do not know.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006038">And there is no animal that walks upon the earth nor a bird that flies with its two wings but (they are) genera like yourselves; We have not neglected anything in the Book, then to their Lord shall they be gathered.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006039">And they who reject Our communications are deaf and dumb, in utter darkness; whom Allah pleases He causes to err and whom He pleases He puts on the right way.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006040">Say: Tell me if the chastisement of Allah should overtake you or the hour should come upon you, will you call (on others) besides Allah, if you are truthful?</AYA>
		<AYA id="006041">Nay, Him you call upon, so He clears away that for which you pray if He pleases and you forget what you set up (with Him).</AYA>
		<AYA id="006042">And certainly We sent (apostles) to nations before you then We seized them with distress and affliction in order that they might humble themselves.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006043">Yet why did they not, when Our punishment came to them, humble themselves? But their hearts hardened and the Shaitan made what they did fair-seeming to them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006044">But when they neglected that with which they had been admonished, We opened for them the doors of all things, until when they rejoiced in what they were given We seized them suddenly; then lo! they were in utter despair.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006045">So the roots of the people who were unjust were cut off; and all praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the worlds.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006046">Say: Have you considered that if Allah takes away your hearing and your sight and sets a seal on your hearts, who is the god besides Allah that can bring it to you? See how We repeat the communications, yet they turn away.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006047">Say: Have you considered if the chastisement of Allah should overtake you suddenly or openly, will any be destroyed but the unjust people?</AYA>
		<AYA id="006048">And We send not messengers but as announcers of good news and givers of warning, then whoever believes and acts aright, they shall have no fear, nor shall they grieve.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006049">And (as for) those who reject Our communications, chastisement shall afflict them because they transgressed.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006050">Say: I do not say to you, I have with me the treasures of Allah, nor do I know the unseen, nor do I say to you that I am an angel; I do not follow aught save that which is revealed to me. Say: Are the blind and the seeing one alike? Do you not then reflect?</AYA>
		<AYA id="006051">And warn with it those who fear that they shall be gathered to their Lord-- there is no guardian for them, nor any intercessor besides Him-- that they may guard (against evil).</AYA>
		<AYA id="006052">And do not drive away those who call upon their Lord in the morning and the evening, they desire only His favor; neither are you answerable for any reckoning of theirs, nor are they answerable for any reckoning of yours, so that you should drive them away and thus be of the unjust.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006053">And thus do We try some of them by others so that they say: Are these they upon whom Allah has conferred benefit from among us? Does not Allah best know the grateful?</AYA>
		<AYA id="006054">And when those who believe in Our communications come to you, say: Peace be on you, your Lord has ordained mercy on Himself, (so) that if any one of you does evil in ignorance, then turns after that and acts aright, then He is Forgiving, Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006055">And thus do We make distinct the communications and so that the way of the guilty may become clear.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006056">Say: I am forbidden to serve those whom you call upon besides Allah. Say: I do not follow your low desires. for then indeed I should have gone astray and I should not be of those who go aright.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006057">Say: Surely I have manifest proof from my Lord and you call it a lie; I have not with me that which you would hasten; the t judgment is only Allah's; He relates the truth and He is the best of deciders.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006058">Say: If that which you desire to hasten were with me, the matter would have certainly been decided between you and me; and Allah best knows the unjust.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006059">And with Him are the keys of the unseen treasures-- none knows them but He; and He knows what is in the land and the sea, and there falls not a leaf but He knows it, nor a grain in the darkness of the earth, nor anything green nor dry but (it is all) in a clear book.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006060">And He it is Who takes your souls at night (in sleep), and He knows what you acquire in the day, then He raises you up therein that an appointed term may be fulfilled; then to Him is your return, then He will inform you of what you were doing.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006061">And He is the Supreme, above His servants, and He sends keepers over you; until when death comes to one of you, Our messengers cause him to die, and they are not remiss.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006062">Then are they sent back to Allah, their Master, the True one; now surely His is the judgment and He is swiftest in taking account.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006063">Say: Who is it that delivers you from the dangers of the land and the sea (when) you call upon Him (openly) humiliating yourselves, and in secret: If He delivers us from this, we should certainly be of the grateful ones.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006064">Say: Allah delivers you from them and from every distress, but again you set up others (with Him).</AYA>
		<AYA id="006065">Say: He has the power that He should send on you a chastisement from above you or from beneath your feet, or that He should throw you into confusion, (making you) of different parties; and make some of you taste the fighting of others. See how We repeat the communications that they may understand.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006066">And your people call it a lie and it is the very truth. Say: I am not placed in charge of you.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006067">For every prophecy is a term, and you will come to know (it).</AYA>
		<AYA id="006068">And when you see those who enter into false discourses about Our communications, withdraw from them until they enter into some other discourse, and if the Shaitan causes you to forget, then do not sit after recollection with the unjust people.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006069">And nought of the reckoning of their (deeds) shall be against those who guard (against evil), but (theirs) is only to remind, haply they may guard.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006070">And leave those who have taken their religion for a play and an idle sport, and whom this world's life has deceived, and remind (them) thereby lest a soul should be given up to destruction for what it has earned; it shall not have besides Allah any guardian nor an intercessor, and if it should seek to give every compensation, it shall not be accepted from it; these are they who shall be given up to destruction for what they earned; they shall have a drink of boiling water and a painful chastisement because they disbelieved.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006071">Say: Shall we call on that besides Allah, which does not benefit us nor harm us, and shall we be returned back on our heels after Allah has guided us, like him whom the Shaitans have made to fall down perplexed in the earth? He has companions who call him to the right way, (saying): Come to us. Say: Surely the guidance of Allah, that is the (true) guidance, and we are commanded that we should submit to the Lord of the worlds.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006072">And that you should keep up prayer and be careful of (your duty to) Him; and He it is to Whom you shall be gathered.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006073">And He it is Who has created the heavens and the earth with truth, and on the day He says: Be, it is. His word is the truth, and His is the kingdom on the day when the trumpet shall be blown; the Knower of the unseen and the seen; and He is the Wise, the Aware.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006074">And when Ibrahim said to his sire, Azar: Do you take idols for gods? Surely I see you and your people in manifest error.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006075">And thus did We show Ibrahim the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and that he might be of those who are sure.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006076">So when the night over-shadowed him, he saw a star; said he: Is this my Lord? So when it set, he said: I do not love the setting ones.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006077">Then when he saw the moon rising, he said: Is this my Lord? So when it set, he said: If my Lord had not guided me I should certainly be of the erring people.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006078">Then when he saw the sun rising, he said: Is this my Lord? Is this the greatest? So when it set, he said: O my people! surely I am clear of what you set up (with Allah).</AYA>
		<AYA id="006079">Surely I have turned myself, being upright, wholly to Him Who originated the heavens and the earth, and I am not of the polytheists.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006080">And his people disputed with him. He said: Do you dispute with me respecting Allah? And He has guided me indeed; and I do not fear in any way those that you set up with Him, unless my Lord pleases; my Lord comprehends all things in His knowledge; will you not then mind?</AYA>
		<AYA id="006081">And how should I fear what you have set up (with Him), while you do not fear that you have set up with Allah that for which He has not sent down to you any authority; which then of the two parties is surer of security, if you know?</AYA>
		<AYA id="006082">Those who believe and do not mix up their faith with iniquity, those are they who shall have the security and they are those who go aright.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006083">And this was Our argument which we gave to Ibrahim against his people; We exalt in dignity whom We please; surely your Lord is Wise, Knowing.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006084">And We gave to him Ishaq and Yaqoub; each did We guide, and Nuh did We guide before, and of his descendants, Dawood and Sulaiman and Ayub and Yusuf and Haroun; and thus do We reward those who do good (to others).</AYA>
		<AYA id="006085">And Zakariya and Yahya and Isa and Ilyas; every one was of the good;</AYA>
		<AYA id="006086">And Ismail and Al-Yasha and Yunus and Lut; and every one We made to excel (in) the worlds:</AYA>
		<AYA id="006087">And from among their fathers and their descendants and their brethren, and We chose them and guided them into the right way.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006088">This is Allah's guidance, He guides thereby whom He pleases of His servants; and if they had set up others (with Him), certainly what they did would have become ineffectual for them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006089">These are they to whom We gave the book and the wisdom and the prophecy; therefore if these disbelieve in it We have already entrusted with it a people who are not disbelievers in it.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006090">These are they whom Allah guided, therefore follow their guidance. Say: I do not ask you for any reward for it; it is nothing but a reminder to the nations.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006091">And they do not assign to Allah the attributes due to Him when they say: Allah has not revealed anything to a mortal. Say: Who revealed the Book which Musa brought, a light and a guidance to men, which you make into scattered writings which you show while you conceal much? And you were taught what you did not know, (neither) you nor your fathers. Say: Allah then leave them sporting in their vain discourses.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006092">And this is a Book We have revealed, blessed, verifying that which is before it, and that you may warn the metropolis and those around her; and those who believe in the hereafter believe in it, and they attend to their prayers constantly.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006093">And who is more unjust than he who forges a lie against Allah, or says: It has been revealed to me; while nothing has been revealed to him, and he who says: I can reveal the like of what Allah has revealed? and if you had seen when the unjust shall be in the agonies of death and the angels shall spread forth their hands: Give up your souls; today shall you be recompensed with an ignominious chastisement because you spoke against Allah other than the truth and (because) you showed pride against His communications.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006094">And certainly you have come to Us alone as We created you at first, and you have left behind your backs the things which We gave you, and We do not see with you your intercessors about whom you asserted that they were (Allah's) associates in respect to you; certainly the ties between you are now cut off and what you asserted is gone from you.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006095">Surely Allah causes the grain and the stone to germinate; He brings forth the living from the dead and He is the bringer forth of the dead from the living; that is Allah! how are you then turned away.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006096">He causes the dawn to break; and He has made the night for rest, and the sun and the moon for reckoning; this is an arrangement of the Mighty, the Knowing.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006097">And He it is Who has made the stars for you that you might follow the right way thereby in the darkness of the land and the sea; truly We have made plain the communications for a people who know.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006098">And He it is Who has brought you into being from a single soul, then there is (for you) a resting-place and a depository; indeed We have made plain the communications for a people who understand.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006099">And He it is Who sends down water from the cloud, then We bring forth with it buds of all (plants), then We bring forth from it green (foliage) from which We produce grain piled up (in the ear); and of the palm-tree, of the sheaths of it, come forth clusters (of dates) within reach, and gardens of grapes and olives and pomegranates, alike and unlike; behold the fruit of it when it yields the fruit and the ripening of it; most surely there are signs in this for a people who believe.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006100">And they make the jinn associates with Allah, while He created them, and they falsely attribute to Him sons and daughters without knowledge; glory be to Him, and highly exalted is He above what they ascribe (to Him).</AYA>
		<AYA id="006101">Wonderful Originator of the heavens and the earth! How could He have a son when He has no consort, and He (Himself) created everything, and He is the Knower of all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006102">That is Allah, your Lord, there is no god but He; the Creator of all things, therefore serve Him, and He has charge of all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006103">Vision comprehends Him not, and He comprehends (all) vision; and He is the Knower of subtleties, the Aware.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006104">Indeed there have come to you clear proofs from your Lord; whoever will therefore see, it is for his own soul and whoever will be blind, it shall be against himself and I am not a keeper over you.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006105">And thus do We repeat the communications and that they may say: You have read; and that We may make it clear to a people who know.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006106">Follow what is revealed to you from your Lord; there is no god but He; and withdraw from the polytheists.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006107">And if Allah had pleased, they would not have set up others (with Him) and We have not appointed you a keeper over them, and you are not placed in charge of them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006108">And do not abuse those whom they call upon besides Allah, lest exceeding the limits they should abuse Allah out of ignorance. Thus have We made fair seeming to every people their deeds; then to their Lord shall be their return, so He will inform them of what they did.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006109">And they swear by Allah with the strongest of their oaths, that if a sign came to them they would most certainly believe in it. Say: Signs are only with Allah; and what should make you know that when it comes they will not believe?</AYA>
		<AYA id="006110">And We will turn their hearts and their sights, even as they did not believe in it the first time, and We will leave them in their inordinacy, blindly wandering on.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006111">And even if We had sent down to them the angels and the dead had spoken to them and We had brought together all things before them, they would not believe unless Allah pleases, but most of them are ignorant.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006112">And thus did We make for every prophet an enemy, the Shaitans from among men and jinn, some of them suggesting to others varnished falsehood to deceive (them), and had your Lord pleased they would not have done it, therefore leave them and that which they forge.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006113">And that the hearts of those who do not believe in the hereafter may incline to it and that they may be well pleased with it and that they may earn what they are going to earn (of evil).</AYA>
		<AYA id="006114">Shall I then seek a judge other than Allah? And He it is Who has revealed to you the Book (which is) made plain; and those whom We have given the Book know that it is revealed by your Lord with truth, therefore you should not be of the disputers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006115">And the word of your Lord has been accomplished truly and justly; there is none who can change His words, and He is the Hearing, the Knowing.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006116">And if you obey most of those in the earth, they will lead you astray from Allah's way; they follow but conjecture and they only lie.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006117">Surely your Lord-- He best knows who goes astray from His way, and He best knows those who follow the right course.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006118">Therefore eat of that on which Allah's name has been mentioned if you are believers in His communications.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006119">And what reason have you that you should not eat of that on which Allah's name has been mentioned, and He has already made plain to you what He has forbidden to you-- excepting what you are compelled to; and most surely many would lead (people) astray by their low desires out of ignorance; surely your Lord-- He best knows those who exceed the limits.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006120">And abandon open and secret sin; surely they who earn sin shall be recompensed with what they earned.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006121">And do not eat of that on which Allah's name has not been mentioned, and that is most surely a transgression; and most surely the Shaitans suggest to their friends that they should contend with you; and if you obey them, you shall most surely be polytheists.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006122">Is he who was dead then We raised him to life and made for him a light by which he walks among the people, like him whose likeness is that of one in utter darkness whence he cannot come forth? Thus what they did was made fair seeming to the unbelievers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006123">And thus have We made in every town the great ones to be its guilty ones, that they may plan therein; and they do not plan but against their own souls, and they do not perceive.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006124">And when a communication comes to them they say: We will not believe till we are given the like of what Allah's apostles are given. Allah best knows where He places His message. There shall befall those who are guilty humiliation from Allah and severe chastisement because of what they planned.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006125">Therefore (for) whomsoever Allah intends that He would guide him aright, He expands his breast for Islam, and (for) whomsoever He intends that He should cause him to err, He makes his breast strait and narrow as though he were ascending upwards; thus does Allah lay uncleanness on those who do not believe.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006126">And this is the path of your Lord, (a) right (path); indeed We have made the communications clear for a people who mind.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006127">They shall have the abode of peace with their Lord, and He is their guardian because of what they did.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006128">And on the day when He shall gather them all together: O assembly of jinn! you took away a great part of mankind. And their friends from among the men shall say: Our Lord! some of us profited by others and we have reached our appointed term which Thou didst appoint for us. He shall say: The fire is your abode, to abide in it, except as Allah is pleased; surely your Lord is Wise, Knowing.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006129">And thus do We make some of the iniquitous to befriend others on account of what they earned.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006130">O assembly of jinn and men! did there not come to you apostles from among you, relating to you My communications and warning you of the meeting of this day of yours? They shall say: We bear witness against ourselves; and this world's life deceived them, and they shall bear witness against their own souls that they were unbelievers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006131">This is because your Lord would not destroy towns unjustly while their people were negligent.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006132">And all have degrees according to what they do; and your Lord is not heedless of what they do.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006133">And your Lord is the Self-sufficient one, the Lord of mercy; if He pleases, He may take you off, and make whom He pleases successors after you, even as He raised you up from the seed of another people.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006134">Surely what you are threatened with must come to pass and you cannot escape (it).</AYA>
		<AYA id="006135">Say: O my people! act according to your ability; I too am acting; so you will soon come to know, for whom (of us) will be the (good) end of the abode; surely the unjust shall not be successful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006136">And they set apart a portion for Allah out of what He has created of tilth and cattle, and say: This is for Allah-- so they assert-- and this for our associates; then what is for their associates, it reaches not to Allah, and whatever is (set apart) for Allah, it reaches to their associates; evil is that which they judge.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006137">And thus their associates have made fair seeming to most of the polytheists the killing of their children, that they may cause them to perish and obscure for them their religion; and if Allah had pleased, they would not have done it, therefore leave them and that which they forge.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006138">And they say: These are cattle and tilth prohibited, none shall eat them except such as We please-- so they assert-- and cattle whose backs are forbidden, and cattle on which they would not mention Allah's name-- forging a lie against Him; He shall requite them for what they forged.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006139">And they say: What is in the wombs of these cattle is specially for our males, and forbidden to our wives, and if it be stillborn, then they are all partners in it; He will reward them for their attributing (falsehood to Allah); surely He is Wise, Knowing.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006140">They are lost indeed who kill their children foolishly without knowledge, and forbid.what Allah has given to them forging a lie against Allah; they have indeed gone astray, and they are not the followers of the right course.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006141">And He it is Who produces gardens (of vine), trellised and untrellised, and palms and seed-produce of which the fruits are of various sorts, and olives and pomegranates, like and unlike; eat of its fruit when it bears fruit, and pay the due of it on the day of its reaping, and do not act extravagantly; surely He does not love the extravagant.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006142">And of cattle (He created) beasts of burden and those which are fit for slaughter only; eat of what Allah has given you and do not follow the footsteps of the Shaitan; surely he is your open enemy.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006143">Eight in pairs-- two of sheep and two of goats. Say: Has He forbidden the two males or the two females or that which the wombs of the two females contain? Inform me with knowledge if you are truthful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006144">And two of camels and two of cows. Say: Has He forbidden the two males or the two females or that which the wombs of the two females contain? Or were you witnesses when Allah enjoined you this? Who, then, is more unjust than he who forges a lie against Allah that he should lead astray men without knowledge? Surely Allah does not guide the unjust people.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006145">Say: I do not find in that which has been revealed to me anything forbidden for an eater to eat of except that it be what has died of itself, or blood poured forth, or flesh of swine-- for that surely is unclean-- or that which is a transgression, other than (the name of) Allah having been invoked on it; but whoever is driven to necessity, not desiring nor exceeding the limit, then surely your Lord is Forgiving, Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006146">And to those who were Jews We made unlawful every animal having claws, and of oxen and sheep We made unlawful to them the fat of both, except such as was on their backs or the entrails or what was mixed with bones: this was a punishment We gave them on account of their rebellion, and We are surely Truthful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006147">But if they give you the lie, then say: Your Lord is the Lord of All-encompassing mercy; and His punishment cannot be averted from the guilty people.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006148">Those who are polytheists will say: If Allah had pleased we would not have associated (aught with Him) nor our fathers, nor would we have forbidden (to ourselves) anything; even so did those before them reject until they tasted Our punishment. Say: Have you any knowledge with you so you should bring it forth to us? You only follow a conjecture and you only tell lies.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006149">Say: Then Allah's is the conclusive argument; so if He please, He would certainly guide you all.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006150">Say: Bring your witnesses who should bear witness that Allah has forbidden this, then if they bear witness, do not bear witness with them; and follow not the low desires of those who reject Our communications and of those who do not believe in the hereafter, and they make (others) equal to their Lord.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006151">Say: Come I will recite what your Lord has forbidden to you-- (remember) that you do not associate anything with Him and show kindness to your parents, and do not slay your children for (fear of) poverty-- We provide for you and for them-- and do not draw nigh to indecencies, those of them which are apparent and those which are concealed, and do not kill the soul which Allah has forbidden except for the requirements of justice; this He has enjoined you with that you may understand.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006152">And do not approach the property of the orphan except in the best manner until he attains his maturity, and give full measure and weight with justice-- We do not impose on any soul a duty except to the extent of its ability; and when you speak, then be just though it be (against) a relative, and fulfill Allah's covenant; this He has enjoined you with that you may be mindful;</AYA>
		<AYA id="006153">And (know) that this is My path, the right one therefore follow it, and follow not (other) ways, for they will lead you away from His way; this He has enjoined you with that you may guard (against evil).</AYA>
		<AYA id="006154">Again, We gave the Book to Musa to complete (Our blessings) on him who would do good (to others), and making plain all things and a guidance and a mercy, so that they should believe in the meeting of their Lord.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006155">And this is a Book We have revealed, blessed; therefore follow it and guard (against evil) that mercy may be shown to you.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006156">Lest you say that the Book was only revealed to two parties before us and We were truly unaware of what they read.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006157">Or lest you should say: If the Book had been revealed to us, we would certainly have been better guided than they, so indeed there has come to you clear proof from your Lord, and guidance and mercy. Who then is more unjust than he who rejects Allah's communications and turns away from them? We will reward those who turn away from Our communications with an evil chastisement because they turned away.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006158">They do not wait aught but that the angels should come to them, or that your Lord should come, or that some of the signs of your Lord should come. On the day when some of the signs of your Lord shall come, its faith shall not profit a soul which did not believe before, or earn good through its faith. Say: Wait; we too are waiting.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006159">Surely they who divided their religion into parts and became sects, you have no concern with them; their affair is only with Allah, then He will inform them of what they did.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006160">Whoever brings a good deed, he shall have ten like it, and whoever brings an evil deed, he shall be recompensed only with the like of it, and they shall not be dealt with unjustly.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006161">Say: Surely, (as for) me, my Lord has guided me to the right path; (to) a most right religion, the faith of Ibrahim the upright one, and he was not of the polytheists.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006162">Say. Surely my prayer and my sacrifice and my life and my death are (all) for Allah, the Lord of the worlds;</AYA>
		<AYA id="006163">No associate has He; and this am I commanded, and I am the first of those who submit.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006164">Say: What! shall I seek a Lord other than Allah? And He is the Lord of all things; and no soul earns (evil) but against itself, and no bearer of burden shall bear the burden of another; then to your Lord is your return, so He will inform you of that in which you differed.</AYA>
		<AYA id="006165">And He it is Who has made you successors in the land and raised some of you above others by (various) grades, that He might try you by what He has given you; surely your Lord is quick to requite (evil), and He is most surely the Forgiving, the Merciful.</AYA>

	<SOURA id="7" name="The Elevated Place">
		<AYA id="007001">Alif Lam Mim Suad.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007002">A Book revealed to you-- so let there be no straitness in your breast on account of it-- that you may warn thereby, and a reminder close to the believers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007003">Follow what has been revealed to you from your Lord and do not follow guardians besides Him, how little do you mind.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007004">And how many a town that We destroyed, so Our punishment came to it by night or while they slept at midday.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007005">Yet their cry, when Our punishment came to them, was nothing but that they said: Surely we were unjust.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007006">Most certainly then We will question those to whom (the apostles) were sent, and most certainly We will also question the apostles;</AYA>
		<AYA id="007007">Then most certainly We will relate to them with knowledge, and We were not absent.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007008">And the measuring out on that day will be just; then as for him whose measure (of good deeds) is heavy, those are they who shall be successful;</AYA>
		<AYA id="007009">And as for him whose measure (of good deeds) is light those are they who have made their souls suffer loss because they disbelieved in Our communications.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007010">And certainly We have established you in the earth and made in it means of livelihood for you; little it is that you give thanks.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007011">And certainly We created you, then We fashioned you, then We said to the angels: Make obeisance to Adam. So they did obeisance except Iblis; he was not of those who did obeisance.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007012">He said: What hindered you so that you did not make obeisance when I commanded you? He said: I am better than he: Thou hast created me of fire, while him Thou didst create of dust.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007013">He said: Then get forth from this (state), for it does not befit you to behave proudly therein. Go forth, therefore, surely you are of the abject ones.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007014">He said: Respite me until the day when they are raised up.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007015">He said: Surely you are of the respited ones.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007016">He said: As Thou hast caused me to remain disappointed I will certainly lie in wait for them in Thy straight path.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007017">Then I will certainly come to them from before them and from behind them, and from their right-hand side and from their left-hand side; and Thou shalt not find most of them thankful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007018">He said: Get out of this (state), despised, driven away; whoever of them will follow you, I will certainly fill hell with you all.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007019">And (We said): O Adam! Dwell you and your wife in the garden; so eat from where you desire, but do not go near this tree, for then you will be of the unjust.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007020">But the Shaitan made an evil suggestion to them that he might make manifest to them what had been hidden from them of their evil inclinations, and he said: Your Lord has not forbidden you this tree except that you may not both become two angels or that you may (not) become of the immortals.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007021">And he swore to them both: Most surely I am a sincere adviser to you.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007022">Then he caused them to fall by deceit; so when they tasted of the tree, their evil inclinations became manifest to them, and they both began to cover themselves with the leaves of the garden; and their Lord called out to them: Did I not forbid you both from that tree and say to you that the Shaitan is your open enemy?</AYA>
		<AYA id="007023">They said: Our Lord! We have been unjust to ourselves, and if Thou forgive us not, and have (not) mercy on us, we shall certainly be of the losers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007024">He said: Get forth, some of you, the enemies of others, and there is for you in the earth an abode and a provision for a time.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007025">He (also) said: Therein shall you live, and therein shall you die, and from it shall you be raised.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007026">O children of Adam! We have indeed sent down to you clothing to cover your shame, and (clothing) for beauty and clothing that guards (against evil), that is the best. This is of the communications of Allah that they may be mindful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007027">O children of Adam! let not the Shaitan cause you to fall into affliction as he expelled your parents from the garden, pulling off from them both their clothing that he might show them their evil inclinations, he surely sees you, he as well as his host, from whence you cannot see them; surely We have made the Shaitans to be the guardians of those who do not believe.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007028">And when they commit an indecency they say: We found our fathers doing this, and Allah has enjoined it on us. Say: Surely Allah does not enjoin indecency; do you say against Allah what you do not know?</AYA>
		<AYA id="007029">Say: My Lord has enjoined justice, and set upright your faces at every time of prayer and call on Him, being sincere to Him in obedience; as He brought you forth in the beginning, so shall you also return.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007030">A part has He guided aright and (as for another) part, error is justly their due, surely they took the Shaitans for guardians beside Allah, and they think that they are followers of the right</AYA>
		<AYA id="007031">O children of Adam! attend to your embellishments at every time of prayer, and eat and drink and be not extravagant; surely He does not love the extravagant.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007032">Say: Who has prohibited the embellishment of Allah which He has brought forth for His servants and the good provisions? Say: These are for the believers in the life of this world, purely (theirs) on the resurrection day; thus do We make the communications clear for a people who know.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007033">Say: My Lord has only prohibited indecencies, those of them that are apparent as well as those that are concealed, and sin and rebellion without justice, and that you associate with Allah that for which He has not sent down any authority, and that you say against Allah what you do not know.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007034">And for every nation there is a doom, so when their doom is come they shall not remain behind the least while, nor shall they go before.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007035">O children of Adam! if there come to you apostles from among you relating to you My communications, then whoever shall guard (against evil) and act aright-- they shall have no fear nor shall they grieve.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007036">And (as for) those who reject Our communications and turn away from them haughtily-- these are the inmates of the fire they shall abide in it.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007037">Who is then more unjust than he who forges a lie against Allah or rejects His communications? (As for) those, their portion of the Book shall reach them, until when Our messengers come to them causing them to die, they shall say: Where is that which you used to call upon besides Allah? They would say: They are gone away from us; and they shall bear witness against themselves that they were unbelievers</AYA>
		<AYA id="007038">He will say: Enter into fire among the nations that have passed away before you from among jinn and men; whenever a nation shall enter, it shall curse its sister, until when they have all come up with one another into it; the last of them shall say with regard to the foremost of them: Our Lord! these led us astray therefore give them a double chastisement of the fire. He will say: Every one shall have double but you do not know.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007039">And the foremost of them will say to the last of them: So you have no preference over us; therefore taste the chastisement for what you earned.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007040">Surely (as for) those who reject Our communications and turn away from them haughtily, the doors of heaven shall not be opened for them, nor shall they enter the garden until the camel pass through the eye of the needle; and thus do We reward the guilty.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007041">They shall have a bed of hell-fire and from above them coverings (of it); and thus do We reward the unjust.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007042">And (as for) those who believe and do good We do not impose on any soul a duty except to the extent of its ability-- they are the dwellers of the garden; in it they shall abide.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007043">And We will remove whatever of ill-feeling is in their breasts; the rivers shall flow beneath them and they shall say: All praise is due to Allah Who guided us to this, and we would not have found the way had it not been that Allah had guided us; certainly the apostles of our Lord brought the truth; and it shall be cried out to them that this is the garden of which you are made heirs for what you did.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007044">And the dwellers of the garden will call out to the inmates of the fire: Surely we have found what our Lord promised us to be true; have you too found what your Lord promised to be true? They will say: Yes. Then a crier will cry out among them that the curse of Allah is on the unjust.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007045">Who hinder (people) from Allah's way and seek to make it crooked, and they are disbelievers in the hereafter.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007046">And between the two there shall be a veil, and on the most elevated places there shall be men who know all by their marks, and they shall call out to the dwellers of the garden: Peace be on you; they shall not have yet entered it, though they hope.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007047">And when their eyes shall be turned towards the inmates of the fire, they shall say: Our Lord! place us not with the unjust</AYA>
		<AYA id="007048">And the dwellers of the most elevated places shall ca!l out to men whom they will recognize by their marks saying: Of no avail were to you your amassings and your behaving haughtily:</AYA>
		<AYA id="007049">Are these they about whom you swore that Allah will not bestow mercy on them? Enter the garden; you shall have no fear, nor shall you grieve.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007050">And the inmates of the fire shall call out to the dwellers of the garden, saying: Pour on us some water or of that which Allah has given you. They shall say: Surely Allah has prohibited them both to the unbelievers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007051">Who take their religion for an idle sport and a play and this life's world deceives them; so today We forsake them, as they neglected the meeting of this day of theirs and as they denied Our communications.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007052">And certainly We have brought them a Book which We have made clear with knowledge, a guidance and a mercy for a people who believe.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007053">Do they wait for aught but its final sequel? On the day when its final sequel comes about, those who neglected it before will say: Indeed the apostles of our Lord brought the truth; are there for us then any intercessors so that they should intercede on our behalf? Or could we be sent back so that we should do (deeds) other than those which we did? Indeed they have lost their souls and that which they forged has gone away from them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007054">Surely your Lord is Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth in six periods of time, and He is firm in power; He throws the veil of night over the day, which it pursues incessantly; and (He created) the sun and the moon and the stars, made subservient by His command; surely His is the creation and the command; blessed is Allah, the Lord of the worlds.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007055">Call on your Lord humbly and secretly; surely He does not love those who exceed the limits.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007056">And do not make mischief in the earth after its reformation, and call on Him fearing and hoping; surely the mercy of Allah is nigh to those who do good (to others).</AYA>
		<AYA id="007057">And He it is Who sends forth the winds bearing good news before His mercy, until, when they bring up a laden cloud, We drive it to a dead land, then We send down water on it, then bring forth with it of fruits of all kinds; thus shall We bring forth the dead that you may be mindful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007058">And as for the good land, its vegetation springs forth (abundantly) by the permission of its Lord, and (as for) that which is inferior (its herbage) comes forth but scantily; thus do We repeat the communications for a people who give thanks.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007059">Certainly We sent Nuh to his people, so he said: O my people! serve Allah, you have no god other than Him; surely I fear for you the chastisement of a grievous day.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007060">The chiefs of his people said: Most surely we see you in clear error.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007061">He said: O my people! there is no error in me, but I am an apostle from the Lord of the worlds.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007062">I deliver to you the messages of my Lord, and I offer you good advice and I know from Allah what you do not know.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007063">What! do you wonder that a reminder has come to you from your Lord through a man from among you, that he might warn you and that you might guard (against evil) and so that mercy may be shown to you?</AYA>
		<AYA id="007064">But they called him a liar, so We delivered him and those with him in the ark, and We drowned those who rejected Our communications; surely they were a blind people.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007065">And to Ad (We sent) their brother Hud. He said: O my people! serve Allah, you have no god other than Him; will you not then guard (against evil)?</AYA>
		<AYA id="007066">The chiefs of those who disbelieved from among his people said: Most surely we see you in folly, and most surely we think you to be of the liars.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007067">He said: O my people! there is no folly in me, but I am an apostle of the Lord of the worlds.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007068">I deliver to you the messages of my Lord and I am a faithful adviser to you:</AYA>
		<AYA id="007069">What! do you wonder that a reminder has come to you from your Lord through a man from among you that he might warn you? And remember when He made you successors after Nuh's people and increased you in excellence in respect of make; therefore remember the benefits of Allah, that you may be successful</AYA>
		<AYA id="007070">They said: Have you come to us that we may serve Allah alone and give up what our fathers used to serve? Then bring to us what you threaten us with, if you are of the truthful ones.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007071">He said: Indeed uncleanness and wrath from your Lord have lighted upon you; what! do you dispute with me about names which you and your fathers have given? Allah has not sent any authority for them; wait then, I too with you will be of those who wait.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007072">So We delivered him and those with him by mercy from Us, and We cut off the last of those who rejected Our communications and were not believers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007073">And to Samood (We sent) their brother Salih. He said: O my people! serve Allah, you have no god other than Him; clear proof indeed has come to you from your Lord; this is (as) Allah's she-camel for you-- a sign, therefore leave her alone to pasture on Allah's earth, and do not touch her with any harm, otherwise painful chastisement will overtake you.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007074">And remember when He made you successors after Ad and settled you in the land-- you make mansions on its plains and hew out houses in the mountains-- remember therefore Allah's benefits and do not act corruptly in the land, making mischief.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007075">The chief of those who behaved proudly among his people said to those who were considered weak, to those who believed from among them: Do you know that Salih is sent by his Lord? They said: Surely we are believers in what he has been sent with</AYA>
		<AYA id="007076">Those who were haughty said: Surely we are deniers of what you believe in.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007077">So they slew the she-camel and revolted against their Lord's commandment, and they said: O Salih! bring us what you threatened us with, if you are one of the apostles.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007078">Then the earthquake overtook them, so they became motionless bodies in their abode.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007079">Then he turned away from them and said: O my people I did certainly deliver to you the message of my Lord, and I gave you good advice, but you do not love those who give good advice.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007080">And (We sent) Lut when he said to his people: What! do you commit an indecency which any one in the world has not done before you?</AYA>
		<AYA id="007081">Most surely you come to males in lust besides females; nay you are an extravagant people.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007082">And the answer of his people was no other than that they said: Turn them out of your town, surely they are a people who seek to purify (themselves).</AYA>
		<AYA id="007083">So We delivered him and his followers, except his wife; she was of those who remained behind.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007084">And We rained upon them a rain; consider then what was the end of the guilty.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007085">And to Madyan (We sent) their brother Shu'aib. He said: 0 my people! serve Allah, you have no god other than Him; clear proof indeed has come to you from your Lord, therefore give full measure and weight and do not diminish to men their things, and do not make mischief in the land after its reform; this is better for you if you are believers:</AYA>
		<AYA id="007086">And do not lie in wait in every path, threatening and turning away from Allah's way him who believes in Him and seeking to make it crooked; and remember when you were few then He multiplied you, and consider what was the end of the mischief-makers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007087">And if there is a party of you who believe in that with which am sent, and another party who do not believe, then wait patiently until Allah judges between us; and He is the best of the Judges.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007088">The chiefs, those who were proud from among his people said: We will most certainly turn you out, O Shu'aib, and (also; those who believe with you, from our town, or you shall come back to our faith. He said: What! though we dislike (it)?</AYA>
		<AYA id="007089">Indeed we shall have forged a lie against Allah If we go back to your religion after Allah has delivered us from It, and it befits us not that we should go back to it, except if Allah our Lord please: Our Lord comprehends all things :n His knowledge; in Allah do we trust: Our Lord! decide between us and our people with truth; and Thou art the best of deciders.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007090">And the chiefs of those who disbelieved from among his people said: If you follow Shu'aib, you shall then most surely be losers</AYA>
		<AYA id="007091">Then the earthquake overtook them, so they became motionless bodies in their abode.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007092">Those who called Shu'aib a liar were as though they had never dwelt therein; those who called Shu'aib a liar, they were the losers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007093">So he turned away from them and said: O my people! certainly I delivered to you the messages of my Lord and I gave you good advice; how shall I then be sorry for an unbelieving people?</AYA>
		<AYA id="007094">And We did not send a prophet in a town but We overtook its people with distress and affliction in order that they might humble themselves.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007095">Then We gave them good in the place of evil until they became many and said: Distress and happiness did indeed befall our fathers. Then We took them by surprise while they did not perceive.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007096">And if the people of the towns had believed and guarded (against evil) We would certainly have opened up for them blessings from the heaven and the earth, but they rejected, so We overtook them for what they had earned.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007097">What! do the people of the towns then feel secure from Our punishment coming to them by night while they sleep?</AYA>
		<AYA id="007098">What! do the people of the towns feel secure from Our punishment coming to them in the morning while they play?</AYA>
		<AYA id="007099">What! do they then feel secure from Allah's plan? But none feels secure from Allah's plan except the people who shall perish.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007100">Is it not clear to those who inherit the earth after its (former) residents that if We please We would afflict them on account of their faults and set a seal on their hearts so they would not hear.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007101">These towns-- We relate to you some of their stories, and certainly their apostles came to them with clear arguments, but they would not believe in what they rejected at first; thus does Allah set a seal over the hearts of the unbelievers</AYA>
		<AYA id="007102">And We did not find in most of them any (faithfulness to) covenant, and We found most of them to be certainly transgressors.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007103">Then we raised after them Musa with Our communications to Firon and his chiefs, but they disbelieved in them; consider then what was the end of the mischief makers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007104">And Musa said: O Firon! surely I am an apostle from the Lord of the worlds:</AYA>
		<AYA id="007105">(I am) worthy of not saying anything about Allah except the truth: I have come to you indeed with clear proof from your Lord, therefore send with me the children of Israel</AYA>
		<AYA id="007106">He said: If you have come with a sign, then bring it, if you are of the truthful ones.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007107">So he threw his rod, then lo! it was a clear serpent.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007108">And he drew forth his hand, and lo! it was white to the beholders.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007109">The chiefs of Firon's people said: most surely this is an enchanter possessed of knowledge:</AYA>
		<AYA id="007110">He intends to turn you out of your land. What counsel do you then give?</AYA>
		<AYA id="007111">They said: Put him off and his brother, and send collectors into the cities:</AYA>
		<AYA id="007112">That they may bring to you every enchanter possessed of knowledge.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007113">And the enchanters came to Firon (and) said: We must surely have a reward if we are the prevailing ones.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007114">He said: Yes, and you shall certainly be of those who are near (to me).</AYA>
		<AYA id="007115">They said: O Musa! will you cast, or shall we be the first to cast?</AYA>
		<AYA id="007116">He said: Cast. So when they cast, they deceived the people's eyes and frightened them, and they produced a mighty enchantment.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007117">And We revealed to Musa, saying: Cast your rod; then lo! it devoured the lies they told.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007118">So the truth was established, and what they did became null.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007119">Thus they were vanquished there, and they went back abased.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007120">And the enchanters were thrown down, prostrating (themselves).</AYA>
		<AYA id="007121">They said: We believe in the Lord of the worlds,</AYA>
		<AYA id="007122">The Lord of Musa and Haroun.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007123">Firon said: Do you believe in Him before I have given you permission? Surely this is a plot which you have secretly devised in this city, that you may turn out of it its people, but you shall know:</AYA>
		<AYA id="007124">1 will certainly cut off your hands and your feet on opposite sides, then will I crucify you all together.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007125">They said: Surely to our Lord shall we go back:</AYA>
		<AYA id="007126">And you do not take revenge on us except because we have believed in the communications of our Lord when they came to us! Our Lord: Pour out upon us patience and cause us to die in submission.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007127">And the chiefs of Firon's people said: Do you leave Musa and his people to make mischief in the land and to forsake you and your gods? He said: We will slay their sons and spare their women, and surely we are masters over them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007128">Musa said to his people: Ask help from Allah and be patient; surely the land is Allah's; He causes such of His servants to inherit it as He pleases, and the end is for those who guard (against evil).</AYA>
		<AYA id="007129">They said: We have been persecuted before you came to us and since you have come to us. He said: It may be that your Lord will destroy your enemy and make you rulers in the land, then He will see how you act.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007130">And certainly We overtook Firon's people with droughts and diminution of fruits that they may be mindful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007131">But when good befell them they said: This is due to us; and when evil afflicted them, they attributed it to the ill-luck of Musa and those with him; surely their evil fortune is only from Allah but most of them do not know.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007132">And they said: Whatever sign you may bring to us to charm us with it-- we will not believe in you.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007133">Therefore We sent upon them widespread death, and the locusts and the lice and the frog and the blood, clear signs; but they behaved haughtily and they were a guilty people.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007134">And when the plague fell upon them, they said: O Musa! pray for us to your Lord as He has promised with you, if you remove the plague from us, we will certainly believe in you and we will certainly send away with you the children of Israel.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007135">But when We removed the plague from them till a term which they should attain lo! they broke (the promise).</AYA>
		<AYA id="007136">Therefore We inflicted retribution on them and drowned them in the sea because they rejected Our signs and were heedless of them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007137">And We made the people who were deemed weak to inherit the eastern lands and the western ones which We had blessed; and the good word of your Lord was fulfilled in the children of Israel because they bore up (sufferings) patiently; and We utterly destroyed what Firon and his people had wrought and what they built.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007138">And We made the children of Israel to pass the sea; then they came upon a people who kept to the worship of their idols They said: O Musa! make for us a god as they have (their) gods He said: Surely you are a people acting ignorantly:</AYA>
		<AYA id="007139">(As to) these, surely that about which they are shall be brought to naught and that which they do is vain.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007140">He said: What! shall I seek for you a god other than Allah while He has made you excel (all) created things?</AYA>
		<AYA id="007141">And when We delivered you from Firon's people who subJected you to severe torment, killing your sons and sparing your women, and in this there was a great trial from your Lord.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007142">And We appointed with Musa a time of thirty nights and completed them with ten (more), so the appointed time of his Lord was complete forty nights, and Musa said to his brother Haroun: Take my place among my people, and act well and do not follow the way of the mischief-makers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007143">And when Musa came at Our appointed time and his Lord spoke to him, he said: My Lord! show me (Thyself), so that I may look upon Thee. He said: You cannot (bear to) see Me but look at the mountain, if it remains firm in its place, then will you see Me; but when his Lord manifested His glory to the mountain He made it crumble and Musa fell down in a swoon; then when he recovered, he said: Glory be to Thee, I turn to Thee, and I am the first of the believers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007144">He said: O Musa! surely I have chosen you above the people with My messages and with My words, therefore take hold of what I give to you and be of the grateful ones.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007145">And We ordained for him in the tablets admonition of every kind and clear explanation of all things; so take hold of them with firmness and enjoin your people to take hold of what is best thereof; I will show you the abode of the transgressors.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007146">1 will turn away from My communications those who are unjustly proud in the earth; and if they see every sign they will not believe m It; and if they see the way of rectitude they do not take It for a way, and if they see the way of error. they take it for a way; this is because they rejected Our communications and were heedless of them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007147">And (as to) those who reject Our communications and the meeting of the hereafter, their deeds are null. Shall they be rewarded except for what they have done?</AYA>
		<AYA id="007148">And Musa's people made of their ornaments a calf after him, a (mere) body, which gave a mooing sound. What! could they not see that it did not speak to them nor guide them m the way? They took it (for worship) and they were unjust.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007149">And when they repented and saw that they had gone astray, they said: If our Lord show not mercy to us and forgive us we shall certainly be of the losers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007150">And when Musa returned to his people, wrathful (and) in violent grief, he said: Evil is it that you have done after me; did you turn away from the bidding of your Lord? And he threw down the tablets and seized his brother by the head, dragging him towards him. He said: Son of my mother! surely the people reckoned me weak and had well-nigh slain me, therefore make not the enemies to rejoice over me and count me not among the unjust people.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007151">He said: My Lord! forgive me and my brother and cause us to enter into Thy mercy, and Thou art the most Merciful of the merciful ones.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007152">(As for) those who took the calf (for a god), surely wrath from their Lord and disgrace in this world's life shall overtake them, and thus do We recompense the devisers of lies.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007153">And (as to) those who do evil deeds, then repent after that and believe, your Lord after that is most surely Forgiving, Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007154">And when Musa's anger calmed down he took up the tablets, and in the writing thereof was guidance and mercy for those who fear for the sake of their Lord.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007155">And Musa chose out of his people seventy men for Our appointment; so when the earthquake overtook them, he said: My Lord! if Thou hadst pleased, Thou hadst destroyed them before and myself (too); wilt Thou destroy us for what the fools among us have done? It is naught but Thy trial, Thou makest err with it whom Thou pleasest and guidest whom Thou pleasest: Thou art our Guardian, therefore forgive us and have mercy on us, and Thou art the best of the forgivers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007156">And ordain for us good in this world's life and m the hereafter, for surely we turn to Thee. He said: (As for) My chastisement, I will afflict with it whom I please, and My mercy encompasses all things; so I will ordain it (specially) for those who guard (against evil) and pay the poor-rate, and those who believe in Our communications.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007157">Those who follow the Apostle-Prophet, the Ummi, whom they find written down with them in the Taurat and the Injeel (who) enjoins them good and forbids them evil, and makes lawful to them the good things and makes unlawful to them impure things, and removes from them their burden and the shackles which were upon them; so (as for) those who believe in him and honor him and help him, and follow the light which has been sent down with him, these it is that are the successful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007158">Say: O people! surely I am the Apostle of Allah to you all, of Him Whose is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth there is no god but He; He brings to life and causes to die therefore believe in Allah and His apostle, the Ummi Prophet who believes in Allah and His words, and follow him so that you may walk in the right way.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007159">And of Musa's people was a party who guided (people) with the truth, and thereby did they do justice.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007160">And We divided them into twelve tribes, as nations; and We revealed to Musa when his people asked him for water: Strike the rock with your staff, so outnowed from it twelve springs; each tribe knew its drinking place; and We made the clouds to give shade over them and We sent to them manna and quails: Eat of the good things We have given you. And they did not do Us any harm, but they did injustice to their own souls.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007161">And when it was said to them: Reside in this town and eat from it wherever you wish, and say, Put down from us our heavy burdens: and enter the gate making obeisance, We will forgive you your wrongs: We will give more to those who do good (to others).</AYA>
		<AYA id="007162">But those who were unjust among them changed it for a saying other than that which had been spoken to them; so We sent upon them a pestilence from heaven because they were unjust.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007163">And ask them about the town which stood by the sea; when they exceeded the limits of the Sabbath, when their fish came to them on the day of their Sabbath, appearing on the surface of the water, and on the day on which they did not keep the Sabbath they did not come to them; thus did We try them because they transgressed.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007164">And when a party of them said: Why do you admonish a with a severe chastisement? They said: To be free from blame before your Lord, and that haply they may guard (against evil).</AYA>
		<AYA id="007165">So when they neglected what they had been reminded of, We delivered those who forbade evil and We overtook those who were unjust with an evil chastisement because they transgressed.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007166">Therefore when they revoltingly persisted in what they had been forbidden, We said to them: Be (as) apes, despised and hated.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007167">And when your Lord announced that He would certainly send against them to the day of resurrection those who would subject them to severe torment; most surely your Lord is quick to requite (evil) and most surely He is Forgiving, Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007168">And We cut them up on the earth into parties, (some) of them being righteous and (others) of them falling short of that, and We tried them with blessings and misfortunes that they might turn.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007169">Then there came after them an evil posterity who inherited the Book, taking only the frail good of this low life and saying: It will be forgiven us. And if the like good came to them, they would take it (too). Was not a promise taken from them in the Book that they would not speak anything about Allah but the truth, and they have read what is in it; and the abode of the hereafter is better for those who guard (against evil). Do you not then understand?</AYA>
		<AYA id="007170">And (as for) those who hold fast by the Book and keep up prayer, surely We do not waste the reward of the right doers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007171">And when We shook the mountain over them as if it were a covering overhead, and they thought that it was going to fall down upon them: Take hold of what We have given you with firmness, and be mindful of what is in it, so that you may guard (against evil).</AYA>
		<AYA id="007172">And when your Lord brought forth from the children of Adam, from their backs, their descendants, and made them bear witness against their own souls: Am I not your Lord? They said: Yes! we bear witness. Lest you should say on the day of resurrection: Surely we were heedless of this.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007173">Or you should say: Only our fathers associated others (with Allah) before, and we were an offspring after them: Wilt Thou then destroy us for what the vain doers did?</AYA>
		<AYA id="007174">And thus do We make clear the communications, and that haply they might return.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007175">And recite to them the narrative of him to whom We give Our communications, but he withdraws himself from them, so the Shaitan overtakes him, so he is of those who go astray.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007176">And if We had pleased, We would certainly have exalted him thereby; but he clung to the earth and followed his low desire, so his parable is as the parable of the dog; if you attack him he lolls out his tongue; and if you leave him alone he lolls out his tongue; this is the parable of the people who reject Our communications; therefore relate the narrative that they may reflect.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007177">Evil is the likeness of the people who reject Our communications and are unjust to their own souls.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007178">Whomsoever Allah guides, he is the one who follows the right way; and whomsoever He causes to err, these are the losers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007179">And certainly We have created for hell many of the jinn and the men; they have hearts with which they do not understand, and they have eyes with which they do not see, and they have ears with which they do not hear; they are as cattle, nay, they are in worse errors; these are the heedless ones.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007180">And Allah's are the best names, therefore call on Him thereby, and leave alone those who violate the sanctity of His names; they shall be recompensed for what they did.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007181">And of those whom We have created are a people who guide with the truth and thereby they do justice.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007182">And (as to) those who reject Our communications, We draw them near (to destruction) by degrees from whence they know not.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007183">And I grant them respite; surely My scheme is effective.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007184">Do they not reflect that their companion has not unsoundness in mind; he is only a plain warner.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007185">Do they not consider the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and whatever things Allah has created, and that may be their doom shall have drawn nigh; what announcement would they then believe in after this?</AYA>

Say: The knowledge of it is only with my Lord; none but He shall manifest it at its time; it will be momentous in the heavens and the earth; it will not come on you but of a sudden. They ask you as if you were solicitous about it. Say: Its knowledge is only with Allah, but most people do not know.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007188">Say: I do not control any benefit or harm for my own soul except as Allah please; and had I known the unseen I would have had much of good and no evil would have touched me; I am nothing but a warner and the giver of good news to a people who believe.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007189">He it is Who created you from a single being, and of the same (kind) did He make his mate, that he might incline to her; so when he covers her she bears a light burden, then moves about with it; but when it grows heavy, they both call upon Allah, their Lord: If Thou givest us a good one, we shall certainly be of the grateful ones.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007190">But when He gives them a good one, thcy set up with Him associates in what He has given them; but high is Allah above what they associate (with Him).</AYA>

		<AYA id="007192">And they have no power to give them help, nor can they help themselves.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007193">And if you invite them to guidance, they will not follow you; it is the same to you whether you invite them or you are silent.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007194">Surely those whom you call on besides Allah are in a state of subjugation like yourselves; therefore call on them, then let them answer you if you are truthful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007195">Have they feet with which they walk, or have they hands with which they hold, or have they eyes with which they see, or have they ears with which they hear? Say: Call your associates, then make a struggle (to prevail) against me and give me no respite.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007196">Surely my guardian is Allah, Who revealed the Book, and He befriends the good.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007197">And those whom you call upon besides Him are not able to help you, nor can they help themselves.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007198">And if you invite them to guidance, they do not hear; and you see them looking towards you, yet they do not see.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007199">Take to forgiveness and enjoin good and turn aside from the ignorant.</AYA>
		<AYA id="007200">And if a false imputation from the Shaitan afflict you, seek refuge in Allah; surely He is Hearing, Knowing.</AYA>

		<AYA id="008009">When you sought aid from your Lord, so He answered you: I will assist you with a thousand of the angels following one another.</AYA>
		<AYA id="008010">And Allah only gave it as a good news and that your hearts might be at ease thereby; and victory is only from Allah; surely Allah is Mighty, Wise.</AYA>
		<AYA id="008011">When He caused calm to fall on you as a security from Him and sent down upon you water from the cloud that He might thereby purify you, and take away from you the uncleanness of the Shaitan, and that He might fortify your hearts and steady (your) footsteps thereby.</AYA>
		<AYA id="008012">When your Lord revealed to the angels: I am with you, therefore make firm those who believe. I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve. Therefore strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="008013">This is because they acted adversely to Allah and His Apostle; and whoever acts adversely to Allah and His Apostle-- then surely Allah is severe in requiting (evil).</AYA>

		<AYA id="008016">And whoever shall turn his back to them on that day-- unless he turn aside for the sake of fighting or withdraws to a company-- then he, indeed, becomes deserving of Allah's wrath, and his abode is hell; and an evil destination shall it be.</AYA>

		<AYA id="008035">And their prayer before the House is nothing but whistling and clapping of hands; taste then the chastisement, for you disbelieved.</AYA>

		<AYA id="008041">And know that whatever thing you gain, a fifth of it is for Allah and for the Apostle and for the near of kin and the orphans and the needy and the wayfarer, if you believe in Allah and in that which We revealed to Our servant, on the day of distinction, the day on which the two parties met; and Allah has power over all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="008042">When you were on the nearer side (of the valley) and they were on the farthest side, while the caravan was in a lower place than you; and if you had mutually made an appointment, you would certainly have broken away from the appointment, but-- in order that Allah might bring about a matter which was to be done, that he who would perish might perish by clear proof, and he who would live might live by clear proof; and most surely Allah is Hearing, Knowing;</AYA>
		<AYA id="008043">When Allah showed them to you in your dream as few; and if He had shown them to you as many you would certainly have become weak-hearted and you would have disputed about the matter, but Allah saved (you); surely He is the Knower of what is in the breasts.</AYA>
		<AYA id="008044">And when He showed them to you, when you met, as few in your eyes and He made you to appear little in their eyes, in order that Allah might bring about a matter which was to be done, and to Allah are all affairs returned.</AYA>

		<AYA id="008048">And when the Shaitan made their works fair seeming to them, and said: No one can overcome you this day, and surely I am your protector: but when the two parties came in sight of each other he turned upon his heels, and said: Surely I am clear of you, surely I see what you do not see, surely I fear Allah; and Allah is severe in requiting (evil).</AYA>
		<AYA id="008049">When the hypocrites and those in whose hearts was disease said: Their religion has deceived them; and whoever trusts in Allah, then surely Allah is Mighty, Wise.</AYA>

		<AYA id="008051">This is for what your own hands have sent on before, and because Allah is not in the least unjust to the servants;</AYA>
		<AYA id="008052">In the manner of the people of Firon and those before them; they disbelieved in Allah's communications, therefore Allah destroyed them on account of their faults; surely Allah is strong, severe in requiting (evil).</AYA>
		<AYA id="008053">This is because Allah has never changed a favor which He has conferred upon a people until they change their own condition; and because Allah is Hearing, Knowing;</AYA>
		<AYA id="008054">In the manner of the people of Firon and those before them; they rejected the communications of their Lord, therefore We destroyed them on account of their faults and We drowned Firon's people, and they were all unjust.</AYA>

		<AYA id="008056">Those with whom you make an agreement, then they break their agreement every time and they do not guard (against punishment).</AYA>
		<AYA id="008057">Therefore if you overtake them in fighting, then scatter by (making an example of) them those who are in their rear, that they may be mindful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="008058">And if you fear treachery on the part of a people, then throw back to them on terms of equality; surely Allah does not love the treacherous.</AYA>
		<AYA id="008059">And let not those who disbelieve think that they shall come in first; surely they will not escape.</AYA>
		<AYA id="008060">And prepare against them what force you can and horses tied at the frontier, to frighten thereby the enemy of Allah and your enemy and others besides them, whom you do not know (but) Allah knows them; and whatever thing you will spend in Allah's way, it will be paid back to you fully and you shall not be dealt with unjustly.</AYA>
		<AYA id="008061">And if they incline to peace, then incline to it and trust in Allah; surely He is the Hearing, the Knowing.</AYA>
		<AYA id="008062">And if they intend to deceive you-- then surely Allah is sufficient for you; He it is Who strengthened you with His help and with the believers</AYA>
		<AYA id="008063">And united their hearts; had you spent all that is in the earth, you could not have united their hearts, but Allah united them; surely He is Mighty, Wise.</AYA>
		<AYA id="008064">O Prophet! Allah is sufficient for you and (for) such of the believers as follow you.</AYA>
		<AYA id="008065">O Prophet! urge the believers to war; if there are twenty patient ones of you they shall overcome two hundred, and if there are a hundred of you they shall overcome a thousand of those who disbelieve, because they are a people who do not understand.</AYA>
		<AYA id="008066">For the present Allah has made light your burden, and He knows that there is weakness in you; so if there are a hundred patient ones of you they shall overcome two hundred, and if there are a thousand they shall overcome two thousand by Allah's permission, and Allah is with the patient.</AYA>
		<AYA id="008067">It is not fit for a prophet that he should take captives unless he has fought and triumphed in the land; you desire the frail goods of this world, while Allah desires (for you) the hereafter; and Allah is Mighty, Wise.</AYA>
		<AYA id="008068">Were it not for an ordinance from Allah that had already gone forth, surely there would have befallen you a great chastisement for what you had taken to.</AYA>
		<AYA id="008069">Eat then of the lawful and good (things) which you have acquired in war, and be careful of (your duty to) Allah; surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="008070">O Prophet! say to those of the captives who are in your hands: If Allah knows anything good in your hearts, He will give to you better than that which has been taken away from you and will forgive you, and Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="008071">And if they intend to act unfaithfully towards you, so indeed they acted unfaithfully towards Allah before, but He gave (you) mastery over them; and Allah is Knowing, Wise.</AYA>
		<AYA id="008072">Surely those who believed and fled (their homes) and struggled hard in Allah's way with their property and their souls, and those who gave shelter and helped-- these are guardians of each other; and (as for) those who believed and did not fly, not yours is their guardianship until they fly; and if they seek aid from you in the matter of religion, aid is incumbent on you except against a people between whom and you there is a treaty, and Allah sees what you do.</AYA>
		<AYA id="008073">And (as for) those who disbelieve, some of them are the guardians of others; if you will not do it, there will be in the land persecution and great mischief.</AYA>
		<AYA id="008074">And (as for) those who believed and fled and struggled hard in Allah's way, and those who gave shelter and helped, these are the believers truly; they shall have forgiveness and honorable provision.</AYA>
		<AYA id="008075">And (as for) those who believed afterwards and fled and struggled hard along with you, they are of you; and the possessors of relationships are nearer to each other in the ordinance of Allah; surely Allah knows all things.</AYA>

		<AYA id="009004">Except those of the idolaters with whom you made an agreement, then they have not failed you in anything and have not backed up any one against you, so fulfill their agreement to the end of their term; surely Allah loves those who are careful (of their duty).</AYA>
		<AYA id="009005">So when the sacred months have passed away, then slay the idolaters wherever you find them, and take them captives and besiege them and lie in wait for them in every ambush, then if they repent and keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate, leave their way free to them; surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful</AYA>

		<AYA id="009008">How (can it be)! while if they prevail against you, they would not pay regard in your case to ties of relationship, nor those of covenant; they please you with their mouths while their hearts do not consent; and most of them are transgressors.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009009">They have taken a small price for the communications of Allah, so they turn away from His way; surely evil is it that they do.</AYA>

		<AYA id="009015">And remove the rage of their hearts; and Allah turns (mercifully) to whom He pleases, and Allah is Knowing, Wise.</AYA>

		<AYA id="009035">On the day when it shall be heated in the fire of hell, then their foreheads and their sides and their backs shall be branded with it; this is what you hoarded up for yourselves, therefore taste what you hoarded.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009036">Surely the number of months with Allah is twelve months in Allah's ordinance since the day when He created the heavens and the earth, of these four being sacred; that is the right reckoning; therefore be not unjust to yourselves regarding them, and fight the polytheists all together as they fight you all together; and know that Allah is with those who guard (against evil).</AYA>
		<AYA id="009037">Postponing (of the sacred month) is only an addition in unbelief, wherewith those who disbelieve are led astray, violating it one year and keeping it sacred another, that they may agree in the number (of months) that Allah has made sacred, and thus violate what Allah has made sacred; the evil of their doings is made fairseeming to them; and Allah does not guide the unbelieving people.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009038">O you who believe!

But the provision of this world's life compared with the hereafter is but little.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009039">If you do not go forth, He will chastise you with a painful chastisement and bring in your place a people other than you, and you will do Him no harm; and Allah has power over all things.</AYA>

So Allah sent down His tranquillity upon him and strengthened him with hosts which you did not see, and made lowest the word of those who disbelieved; and the word of Allah, that is the highest; and Allah is Mighty, Wise.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009041">Go forth light and heavy, and strive hard in Allah's way with your property and your persons; this is better for you, if you know.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009042">Had it been a near advantage and a short journey, they would certainly have followed you, but the tedious journey was too long for them; and they swear by Allah: If we had been able, we would certainly have gone forth with you; they cause their own souls to perish, and Allah knows that they are most surely</AYA>
		<AYA id="009043">Allah pardon you! Why did you give them leave until those who spoke the truth had become manifest to you and you had known the liars?</AYA>
		<AYA id="009044">They do not ask leave of you who believe in Allah and the latter day (to stay away) from striving hard with their property and their persons, and Allah knows those who guard (against evil).</AYA>
		<AYA id="009045">They only ask leave of you who do not believe in Allah and the latter day and their hearts are in doubt, so in their doubt do they waver.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009046">And if they had intended to go forth, they would certainly have provided equipment for it, but Allah did not like their going forth, so He withheld them, and it was said (to them): Hold back with those who hold back.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009047">Had they gone forth with you, they would not have added to you aught save corruption, and they would certainly have hurried about among you seeking (to sow) dissension among you, and among you there are those who hearken for their sake; and Allah knows the unjust.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009048">Certainly they sought (to sow) dissension before, and they meditated plots against you until the truth came, and Allah's commandment prevailed although they were averse (from it).</AYA>
		<AYA id="009049">And among them there is he who says: Allow me and do not try me. Surely into trial have they already tumbled down, and most surely hell encompasses the unbelievers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009050">If good befalls you, it grieves them, and if hardship afflicts you, they say: Indeed we had taken care of our affair before; and they turn back and are glad.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009051">Say: Nothing will afflict us save what Allah has ordained for us; He is our.Patron; and on Allah let the believers rely.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009052">Say: Do you await for us but one of two most excellent things? And we await for you that Allah will afflict you with punishment from Himself or by our hands. So wait; we too will wait with you.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009053">Say: Spend willingly or unwillingly, it shall not be accepted from you; surely you are a transgressing people.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009054">And nothing hinders their spendings being accepted from them, except that they disbelieve in Allah and in His Apostle and they do not come to prayer but while they are sluggish, and they do not spend but while they are unwilling.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009055">Let not then their property and their children excite your admiration; Allah only wishes to chastise them with these in this world's life and (that) their souls may depart while they are unbelievers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009056">And they swear by Allah that they are most surely of you, and they are not of you, but they are a people who are afraid (of you).</AYA>
		<AYA id="009057">If they could find a refuge or cave or a place to enter into, they would certainly have turned thereto, running away in all haste.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009058">And of them there are those who blame you with respect to the alms; so if they are given from it they are pleased, and if they are not given from it, lo! they are full of rage.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009059">And if they were content with what Allah and His Apostle gave them, and had said: Allah is sufficient for us; Allah will soon give us (more) out of His grace and His Apostle too; surely to Allah do we make our petition.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009060">Alms are only for the poor and the needy, and the officials (appointed) over them, and those whose hearts are made to incline (to truth) and the (ransoming of) captives and those in debts and in the way of Allah and the wayfarer; an ordinance from Allah; and Allah is knowing, Wise.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009061">And there are some of them who molest the Prophet and say: He is one who believes every thing that he hears; say: A hearer of good for you (who) believes in Allah and believes the faithful and a mercy for those of you who believe; and (as for) those who molest the Apostle of Allah, they shall have a painful punishment.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009062">They swear to you by Allah that they might please you and, Allah, as well as His Apostle, has a greater right that they should please Him, if they are believers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009063">Do they not know that whoever acts in opposition to Allah and His Apostle, he shall surely have the fire of hell to abide in it? That is the grievous abasement.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009064">The hypocrites fear lest a chapter should be sent down to them telling them plainly of what is in their hearts. Say: Go on mocking, surely Allah will bring forth what you fear.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009065">And if you should question them, they would certainly say: We were only idly discoursing and sporting. Say: Was it at Allah and His communications and His Apostle that you mocked?</AYA>
		<AYA id="009066">Do not make excuses; you have denied indeed after you had believed; if We pardon a party of you, We will chastise (another) party because they are guilty.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009067">The hypocritical men and the hypocritical women are all alike; they enjoin evil and forbid good and withhold their hands; they have forsaken Allah, so He has forsaken them; surely the hypocrites are the transgressors.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009068">Allah has promised the hypocritical men and the hypocritical women and the unbelievers the fire of hell to abide therein; it is enough for them; and Allah has cursed them and they shall have lasting punishment.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009069">Like those before you; they were stronger than you in power and more abundant in wealth and children, so they enjoyed their portion; thus have you enjoyed your portion as those before you enjoyed their portion; and you entered into vain discourses like the vain discourses in which entered those before you. These are they whose works are null in this world and the hereafter, and these are they who are the losers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009070">Has not the news of those before them come to them; of the people of Nuh and Ad and Samood, and the people of Ibrahim and the dwellers of Madyan and the overthrown cities; their apostles came to them with clear arguments; so it was not Allah Who should do them injustice, but they were unjust to themselves.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009071">And (as for) the believing men and the believing women, they are guardians of each other; they enjoin good and forbid evil and keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate, and obey Allah and His Apostle; (as for) these, Allah will show mercy to them; surely Allah is Mighty, Wise.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009072">Allah has promised to the believing men and the believing women gardens, beneath which rivers flow, to abide in them, and goodly dwellings in gardens of perpetual abode; and best of all is Allah's goodly pleasure; that is the grand achievement.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009073">O Prophet! strive hard against the unbelievers and the hypocrites and be unyielding to them; and their abode is hell, and evil is the destination.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009074">They swear by Allah that they did not speak, and certainly they did speak, the word of unbelief, and disbelieved after their Islam, and they had determined upon what they have not been able to effect, and they did not find fault except because Allah and His Apostle enriched them out of His grace; therefore if they repent, it will be good for them; and if they turn back, Allah will chastise them with a painful chastisement in this world and the hereafter, and they shall not have in the land any guardian or a helper.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009075">And there are those of them who made a covenant with Allah: If He give us out of His grace, we will certainly give alms and we will certainly be of the good.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009076">But when He gave them out of His grace, they became niggardly of it and they turned back and they withdrew.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009077">So He made hypocrisy to follow as a consequence into their hearts till the day when they shall meet Him because they failed to perform towards Allah what they had promised with Him and because they told lies.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009078">Do they not know that Allah knows their hidden thoughts and their secret counsels, and that Allah is the great Knower of the unseen things?</AYA>
		<AYA id="009079">They who taunt those of the faithful who give their alms freely, and those who give to the extent of their earnings and scoff at them; Allah will pay them back their scoffing, and they shall have a painful chastisement.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009080">Ask forgiveness for them or do not ask forgiveness for them; even if you ask forgiveness for them seventy times, Allah will not forgive them; this is because they disbelieve in Allah and His Apostle, and Allah does not guide the transgressing people</AYA>
		<AYA id="009081">Those who were left behind were glad on account of their sitting behind Allah's Apostle and they were averse from striving m Allah's way with their property and their persons, and said: Do not go forth in the heat. Say: The fire of hell is much severe in heat. Would that they understood (it).</AYA>
		<AYA id="009082">Therefore they shall laugh little and weep much as a recompense for what they earned.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009083">Therefore if Allah brings you back to a party of them and then they ask your permission to go forth, say: By no means shall you ever go forth with me and by no means shall you fight an enemy with me; surely you chose to sit the first time, therefore sit (now) with those who remain behind.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009084">And never offer prayer for any one of them who dies and do not stand by his grave; surely they disbelieve in Allah and His Apostle and they shall die in transgression.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009085">And let not their property and their children excite your admlration; Allah only wishes to chastise them with these in this world and (that) their souls may depart while they are unbelievers</AYA>
		<AYA id="009086">And whenever a chapter is revealed, saying: Believe in Allah and strive hard along with His Apostle, those having ampleness of means ask permission of you and say: Leave us (behind), that we may be with those who sit.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009087">They preferred to be with those who remained behind, and a seal is set on their hearts so they do not understand.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009088">But the Apostle and those who believe with him strive hard with their property and their persons; and these it is who shall have the good things and these it is who shall be successful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="009089">Allah has prepared for them gardens beneath which rivers flow, to abide in them; that is the great achievement. And the defaulters from among the dwellers of the desert came that permission may be given to them and they sat (at home) who lied to Allah and His Apostle; a painful chastisement shall afflict those of them who disbelieved.</AYA>

	<SOURA id="10" name="Yunus">
		<AYA id="010001">Alif Lam Ra. These are the verses of the wise Book.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010002">What! is it a wonder to the people that We revealed to a man from among themselves, saying: Warn the people and give good news to those who believe that theirs is a footing of firmness with their Lord. The unbelievers say: This is most surely a manifest enchanter.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010003">Surely your Lord is Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth in six periods, and He is firm in power, regulating the affair, there is no intercessor except aher His permission; this is Allah, your Lord, therefore serve Him; will you not then mind?</AYA>
		<AYA id="010004">To Him is your return, of all (of you); the promise of Allah (made) in truth; surely He begins the creation in the first mstance, then He reproduces it, that He may with justice recompense those who believe and do good; and (as for) those who disbelieve, they shall have a drink of hot water and painful punishment because they disbelieved.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010005">He it is Who made the sun a shining brightness and the moon a light, and ordained for it mansions that you might know the computation of years and the reckoning. Allah did not create it but with truth; He makes the signs manifest for a people who</AYA>
		<AYA id="010006">Most surely in the variation of the night and the day, and what Allah has created in the heavens and the earth, there are signs for a people who guard (against evil).</AYA>
		<AYA id="010007">Surely those who do not hope in Our meeting and are pleased with this world's life and are content with it, and those who are heedless of Our communications:</AYA>
		<AYA id="010008">(As for) those, their abode is the fire because of what they earned.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010009">Surely (as for) those who believe and do good, their Lord will guide them by their faith; there shall flOw from beneath them rivers in gardens of bliss.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010010">Their cry in it shall be: Glory to Thee, O Allah! and their greeting in it shall be: Peace; and the last of their cry shall be: Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the worlds.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010011">And if Allah should hasten the evil to men as they desire the hastening on of good, their doom should certainly have been decreed for them; but We leave those alone who hope not for Our meeting in their inordinacy, blindly wandering on.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010012">And when affliction touches a man, he calls on Us, whether lying on his side or sitting or standing; but when We remove his affliction from him, he passes on as though he had never called on Us on account of an affliction that touched him; thus that which they do is made fair-seeming to the extravagant.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010013">And certainly We did destroy generations before you when they were unjust, and their apostles had come to them with clear arguments, and they would not believe; thus do We recompense the guilty people.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010014">Then We made you successors in the land after them so that We may see how you act.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010015">And when Our clear communications are recited to them, those who hope not for Our meeting say: Bring a Quran other than this or change it. Say: It does not beseem me that I should change it of myself; I follow naught but what is revealed to me; surely I fear, if I disobey my Lord, the punishment of a mighty day.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010016">Say: If Allah had desired (otherwise) I would not have recited it to you, nor would He have taught it to you; indeed I have lived a lifetime among you before it; do you not then understand?</AYA>
		<AYA id="010017">Who is then more unjust than who forges a lie against Allah or (who) gives the lie to His communications? Surely the guilty shall not be successful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010018">And they serve beside Allah what can neither harm them nor profit them, and they say: These are our intercessors with Allah. Say: Do you (presume to) inform Allah of what He knows not in the heavens and the earth? Glory be to Him, and supremely exalted is He above what they set up (with Him).</AYA>
		<AYA id="010019">And people are naught but a single nation, so they disagree; and had not a word already gone forth from your Lord, the matter would have certainly been decided between them in respect of that concerning which they disagree.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010020">And they say: Why is not a sign sent to him from his Lord? Say: The unseen is only for Allah; therefore wait-- surely I too, with you am of those who wait.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010021">And when We make people taste of mercy after an affliction touches them, lo ! they devise plans against Our communication. Say: Allah is quicker to plan; surely Our messengers write down what you plan.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010022">He it is Who makes you travel by land and sea; until when you are in the ships, and they sail on with them in a pleasant breeze, and they rejoice, a violent wind overtakes them and the billows surge in on them from all sides, and they become certain that they are encompassed about, they pray to Allah, being sincere to Him in obedience: If Thou dost deliver us from this, we will most certainly be of the grateful ones.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010023">But when He delivers them, lo! they are unjustly rebellious in the earth. O men! your rebellion is against your own souls-- provision (only) of this world's life-- then to Us shall be your return, so We will inform you of what you did.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010024">The likeness of this world's life is only as water which We send down from the cloud, then the herbage of the earth of which men and cattle eat grows luxuriantly thereby, until when the earth puts on its golden raiment and it becomes garnished, and its people think that they have power over it, Our command comes to it, by night or by day, so We render it as reaped seed; produce, as though it had not been in existence yesterday; thus do We make clear the communications for a people who reflect.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010025">And Allah invites to the abode of peace and guides whom He pleases into the right path.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010026">For those who do good is good (reward) and more (than this); and blackness or ignominy shall not cover their faces; these are the dwellers of the garden; in it they shall abide.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010027">And (as for) those who have earned evil, the punishment of an evil is the like of it, and abasement shall come upon them-- they shall have none to protect them from Allah-- as if their faces had been covered with slices of the dense darkness of night; these are the inmates of the fire; in it they shall abide.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010028">And on the day when We will gather them all together, then We will say to those who associated others (with Allah): Keep where you are, you and your associates; then We shall separate them widely one from another and their associates would say: It was not us that you served:</AYA>
		<AYA id="010029">Therefore Allah is sufficient as a witness between us and you that we were quite unaware of your serving (us).</AYA>
		<AYA id="010030">There shall every soul become acquainted with what it sent before, and they shall be brought back to Allah, their true Patron, and what they devised shall escape from them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010031">Say: Who gives you sustenance from the heaven and the earth? Or Who controls the hearing and the sight? And Who brings forth the living from the dead, and brings forth the dead from the living? And Who regulates the affairs? Then they will say: Allah. Say then: Will you not then guard (against evil)?</AYA>
		<AYA id="010032">This then is Allah, your true Lord; and what is there after the truth but error; how are you then turned back?</AYA>
		<AYA id="010033">Thus does the word of your Lord prove true against those who transgress that they do not believe.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010034">Say: Is there any one among your associates who can bring into existence the creation in the first instance, then reproduce it? Say: Allah brings the creation into existence, then He reproduces it; how are you then turned away?</AYA>
		<AYA id="010035">Say: Is there any of your associates who guides to the truth? Say: Allah guides to the truth. Is He then Who guides to the truth more worthy to be followed, or he who himself does not go aright unless he is guided? What then is the matter with you; how do you judge?</AYA>
		<AYA id="010036">And most of them do not follow (anything) but conjecture; surely conjecture will not avail aught against the truth; surely Allah is cognizant of what they do.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010037">And this Quran is not such as could be forged by those besides Allah, but it is a verification of that which is before it and a clear explanation of the book, there is no doubt in it, from the Lord of the worlds.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010038">Or do they say: He has forged it? Say: Then bring a chapter like this and invite whom you can besides Allah, if you are truthful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010039">Nay, they reject that of which they have no comprehensive knowledge, and the final sequel of it has not yet come to them; even thus did those before them reject (the truth); see then what was the end of the unjust.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010040">And of them is he who believes in it, and of them is he who does not believe in it, and your Lord best knows the mischief-makers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010041">And if they call you a liar, say: My work is for me and your work for you; you are clear of what I do and I am clear of what you do.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010042">And there are those of them who hear you, but can you make the deaf to hear though they will not understand?</AYA>
		<AYA id="010043">And there are those of them who look at you, but can you show the way to the blind though they will not see?</AYA>
		<AYA id="010044">Surely Allah does not do any injustice to men, but men are unjust to themselves.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010045">And on the day when He will gather them as though they had not stayed but an hour of the day, they will know each other. They will perish indeed who called the meeting with Allah to be a lie, and they are not followers of the right direction.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010046">And if We show you something of what We threaten them with, or cause you to die, yet to Us is their return, and Allah is the bearer of witness to what they do.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010047">And every nation had an apostle; so when their apostle came, the matter was decided between them with justice and they shall not be dealt with unjustly.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010048">And they say: When will this threat come about, if you are truthful?</AYA>
		<AYA id="010049">Say: I do not control for myself any harm, or any benefit except what Allah pleases; every nation has a term; when their term comes, they shall not then remain behind for an hour, nor can they go before (their time).</AYA>
		<AYA id="010050">Say: Tell me if His punishment overtakes you by night or by day! what then is there of it that the guilty would hasten on?</AYA>
		<AYA id="010051">And when it comes to pass, will you believe in it? What! now (you believe), and already you wished to have it hastened on.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010052">Then it shall be said to those who were unjust: Taste abiding chastisement; you are not requited except for what you earned.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010053">And they ask you: Is that true? Say: Aye! by my Lord! it is most surely the truth, and you will not escape.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010054">And if every soul that has done injustice had all that is in the earth, it would offer it for ransom, and they will manifest regret when they see the chastisement and the matter shall be decided between them with justice and they shall not be dealt with unjustly.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010055">Now surely Allah's is what is in the heavens and the earth; now surely Allah's promise is true, but most of them do not know.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010056">He gives life and causes death, and to Him you shall be brought back.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010057">O men! there has come to you indeed an admonition from your Lord and a healing for what is in the breasts and a guidance and a mercy for the believers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010058">Say: In the grace of Allah and in His mercy-- in that they should rejoice; it is better than that which they gather.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010059">Say: Tell me what Allah has sent down for you of sustenance, then you make (a part) of it unlawful and (a part) lawful. Say: Has Allah commanded you, or do you forge a lie against Allah?</AYA>
		<AYA id="010060">And what will be the thought of those who forge lies against Allah on the day of resurrection? Most surely Allah is the Lord of grace towards men, but most of them do not give thanks.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010061">And you are not (engaged) in any affair, nor do you recite concerning it any portion of the Quran, nor do you do any work but We are witnesses over you when you enter into it, and there does not lie concealed from your Lord the weight of an atom in the earth or in the heaven, nor any thing less than that nor greater, but it is in a clear book.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010062">Now surely the friends of Allah-- they shall have no fear nor shall they grieve</AYA>
		<AYA id="010063">Those who believe and guarded (against evil):</AYA>
		<AYA id="010064">They shall have good news in this world's life and in the hereafter; there is no changing the words of Allah; that is the mighty achievement.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010065">And let not their speech grieve you; surely might is wholly Allah's; He is the Hearing, the Knowing.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010066">Now, surely, whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth is Allah's; and they do not (really) follow any associates, who call on others besides Allah; they do not follow (anything) but conjectures, and they only lie.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010067">He it is Who made for you the night that you might rest in it, and the day giving light; most surely there are signs in it for a people who would hear.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010068">They say: Allah has taken a son (to Himself)! Glory be to Him: He is the Self-sufficient: His is what is in the heavens and what is in the earth; you have no authority for this; do you say against Allah what you do not know?</AYA>
		<AYA id="010069">Say: Those who forge a lie against Allah shall not be successful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010070">(It is only) a provision in this world, then to Us shall be their return; then We shall make them taste severe punishment because they disbelieved.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010071">And recite to them the story of Nuh when he said to his people: O my people! if my stay and my reminding (you) by the communications of Allah is hard on you-- yet on Allah do I rely-- then resolve upon your affair and (gather) your associates, then let not your affair remain dubious to you, then have it executed against me and give me no respite:</AYA>
		<AYA id="010072">But if you turn back, I did not ask for any reward from you; my reward is only with Allah, and I am commanded that I should be of those who submit.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010073">But they rejected him, so We delivered him and those with him in the ark, and We made them rulers and drowned those who rejected Our communications; see then what was the end of the (people) warned.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010074">Then did We raise up after him apostles to their people, so they came to them with clear arguments, but they would not believe in what they had rejected before; thus it is that We set seals upon the hearts of those who exceed the limits.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010075">Then did We send up after them Musa and Haroun to Firon and his chiefs with Our signs, but they showed pride and they were a guilty people.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010076">So when the truth came to them from Us they said: This is most surely clear enchantment!</AYA>
		<AYA id="010077">Musa said: Do you say (this) of the truth when it has come to you? Is it magic? And the magicians are not successful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010078">They said: Have you come to us to turn us away from what we found our fathers upon, and (that) greatness in the land should be for you two? And we are not going to believe in you.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010079">And Firon said: Bring to me every skillful magician.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010080">And when the magicians came, Musa said to them: Cast down what you have to cast.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010081">So when they cast down, Musa said to them: What you have brought is deception; surely Allah will make it naught; surely Allah does not make the work of mischief-makers to thrive.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010082">And Allah will show the truth to be the truth by His words, though the guilty may be averse (to it).</AYA>
		<AYA id="010083">But none believed in Musa except the offspring of his people, on account of the fear of Firon and their chiefs, lest he should persecute them; and most surely Firon was lofty in the land; and most surely he was of the extravagant.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010084">And Musa said: O my people! if you believe in Allah, then rely on Him (alone) if you submit (to Allah).</AYA>
		<AYA id="010085">So they said: On Allah we rely: O our Lord! make us not subject to the persecution of the unjust people:</AYA>
		<AYA id="010086">And do Thou deliver us by Thy mercy from the unbelieving people.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010087">And We revealed to Musa and his brother, saying: Take for your people houses to abide in Egypt and make your houses places of worship and keep up prayer and give good news to the believers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010088">And Musa said: Our Lord! surely Thou hast given to Firon and his chiefs finery and riches in this world's life, to this end, our Lord, that they lead (people) astray from Thy way: Our Lord! destroy their riches and harden their hearts so that they believe not until they see the painful punishment.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010089">He said: The prayer of you both has indeed been accepted, therefore continue in the right way and do not follow the path of those who do not know.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010090">And We made the children of Israel to pass through the sea, then Firon and his hosts followed them for oppression and tyranny; until when drowning overtook him, he said: I believe that there is no god but He in Whom the children of Israel believe and I am of those who submit.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010091">What! now! and indeed you disobeyed before and you were of the mischief-makers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010092">But We will this day deliver you with your body that you may be a sign to those after you, and most surely the majority of the people are heedless to Our communications.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010093">And certainly We lodged the children of Israel in a goodly abode and We provided them with good things; but they did not disagree until the knowledge had come to them; surely your Lord will judge between them on the resurrection day concerning that in which they disagreed.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010094">But if you are in doubt as to what We have revealed to you, ask those who read the Book before you; certainly the truth has come to you from your Lord, therefore you should not be of the disputers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010095">And you should not be of those who reject the communications of Allah, (for) then you should be one of the losers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010096">Surely those against whom the word of your Lord has proved true will not believe,</AYA>
		<AYA id="010097">Though every sign should come to them, until they witness the painful chastisement.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010098">And wherefore was there not a town which should believe so that their belief should have profited them but the people of Yunus? When they believed, We removed from them the chastisement of disgrace in this world's life and We gave them provision till a time.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010099">And if your Lord had pleased, surely all those who are in the earth would have believed, all of them; will you then force men till they become believers?</AYA>
		<AYA id="010100">And it is not for a soul to believe except by Allah's permission; and He casts uncleanness on those who will not understand.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010101">Say: Consider what is it that is in the heavens and the earth; and signs and warners do not avail a people who would not believe.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010102">What do they wait for then but the like of the days of those who passed away before them? Say: Wait then; surely I too am with you of those who wait.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010103">Then We deliver Our apostles and those who believe-- even so (now), it is binding on Us (that) We deliver the believers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010104">Say: O people! if you are in doubt as to my religion, then (know that) I do not serve those whom you serve besides Allah but I do serve Allah, Who will cause you to die, and I am commanded that I should be of the believers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010105">And that you should keep your course towards the religion uprightly; and you should not be of the polytheists.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010106">And do not call besides Allah on that which can neither benefit you nor harm you, for if you do then surely you will in that case be of the unjust.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010107">And if Allah should afflict you with harm, then there is none to remove it but He; and if He intends good to you there is none to repel His grace; He brings it to whom He pleases of His servants; and He is the Forgiving, the Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010108">Say: O people! indeed there has come to you the truth from your Lord, therefore whoever goes aright, he goes aright only for the good of his own soul, and whoever goes astray, he goes astray only to the detriment of it, and I am not a custodian over you.</AYA>
		<AYA id="010109">And follow what is revealed to you and be patient till Allah should give judgment, and He is the best of the judges.</AYA>

	<SOURA id="11" name="Hud">
		<AYA id="011001">Alif Lam Ra (This is) a Book, whose verses are made decisive, then are they made plain, from the Wise, All-aware:</AYA>
		<AYA id="011002">That you shall not serve (any) but Allah; surely I am a warner for you from Him and a giver of good news,</AYA>
		<AYA id="011003">And you that ask forgiveness of your Lord, then turn to Him; He will provide you with a goodly provision to an appointed term and bestow His grace on every one endowed with grace, and if you turn back, then surely I fear for you the chastisement of a great day.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011004">To Allah is your return, and He has power over all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011005">Now surely they fold up their breasts that they may conceal (their enmity) from Him; now surely, when they use their garments as a covering, He knows what they conceal and what they make public; surely He knows what is in the breasts.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011006">And there is no animal in the earth but on Allah is the sustenance of it, and He knows its resting place and its depository all (things) are in a manifest book.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011007">And He it is Who created the heavens and the earth in six periods-- and His dominion (extends) on the water-- that He might manifest to you, which of you is best in action, and if you say, surely you shall be raised up after death, those who disbelieve would certainly say: This is nothing but clear magic.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011008">And if We hold back from them the punishment until a stated period of time, they will certainly say: What prevents it? Now surely on the day when it will come to them, it shall not be averted from them and that which they scoffed at shall beset them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011009">And if We make man taste mercy from Us, then take it off from him, most surely he is despairing, ungrateful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011010">And if We make him taste a favor after distress has afflicted him, he will certainly say: The evils are gone away from me. Most surely he is exulting, boasting;</AYA>
		<AYA id="011011">Except those who are patient and do good, they shall have forgiveness and a great reward.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011012">Then, it may be that you will give up part of what is revealed to you and your breast will become straitened by it because they say: Why has not a treasure been sent down upon him or an angel come with him? You are only a warner; and Allah is custodian over all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011013">Or, do they say: He has forged it. Say: Then bring ten forged chapters like it and call upon whom you can besides Allah, if you are truthful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011014">But if they do not answer you, then know that it is revealed by Allah's knowledge and that there is no god but He; will you then submit?</AYA>
		<AYA id="011015">Whoever desires this world's life and its finery, We will pay them in full their deeds therein, and they shall not be made to. suffer loss in respect of them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011016">These are they for whom there is nothing but fire in the hereafter, and what they wrought in it shall go for nothing, and vain is what they do.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011017">Is he then who has with him clear proof from his Lord, and a witness from Him recites it and before it (is) the Book of Musa, a guide and a mercy? These believe in it; and whoever of the (different) parties disbelieves in it, surely it is the truth from your Lord, but most men do not believe.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011018">And who is more unjust than he who forges a lie against Allah? These shall be brought before their Lord, and the witnesses shall say: These are they who lied against their Lord. Now surely the curse of Allah is on the unjust.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011019">Who turn away from the path of Allah and desire to make it crooked; and they are disbelievers in the hereafter.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011020">These shall not escape in the earth, nor shall they have any guardians besides Allah; the punishment shall be doubled for them, they could not bear to hear and they did not see.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011021">These are they who have lost their souls, and what they forged is gone from them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011022">Truly in the hereafter they are the greatest losers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011023">Surely (as to) those who believe and do good and humble themselves to their Lord, these are the dwellers of the garden, in it they will abide.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011024">The likeness of the two parties is as the blind and the deaf and the seeing and the hearing: are they equal in condition? Will you not then mind?</AYA>
		<AYA id="011025">And certainly We sent Nuh to his people: Surely I am a plain warner for you:</AYA>
		<AYA id="011026">That you shall not serve any but Allah, surely I fear for you the punishment of a painful day.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011027">But the chiefs of those who disbelieved from among his people said: We do not consider you but a mortal like ourselves, and we do not see any have followed you but those who are the meanest of us at first thought and we do not see in you any excellence over us; nay, we deem you liars.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011028">He said: O my people! tell me if I have with me clear proof from my Lord, and He has granted me mercy from Himself and it has been made obscure to you; shall we constrain you to (accept) it while you are averse from it?</AYA>
		<AYA id="011029">And, O my people! I ask you not for wealth in return for it; my reward is only with Allah and I am not going to drive away those who believe; surely they shall meet their Lord, but I consider you a people who are ignorant:</AYA>
		<AYA id="011030">And, O my people! who will help me against Allah if I drive them away? Will you not then mind?</AYA>
		<AYA id="011031">And I do not say to you that I have the treasures of Allah and I do not know the unseen, nor do I say that I am an angel, nor do I say about those whom your eyes hold in mean estimation (that) Allah will never grant them (any) good-- Allah knows best what is in their souls-- for then most surely I should be of the unjust.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011032">They said: O Nuh! indeed you have disputed with us and lengthened dispute with us, therefore bring to us what you threaten us with, if you are of the truthful ones.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011033">He said: Allah only will bring it to you if He please, and you will not escape:</AYA>
		<AYA id="011034">And if I intend to give you good advice, my advice will not profit you if Allah intended that He should leave you to go astray; He is your Lord, and to Him shall you be returned.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011035">Or do they say: He has forged it? Say: If I have forged it, on me is my guilt, and I am clear of that of which you are guilty.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011036">And it was revealed to Nuh: That none of your people will believe except those who have already believed, therefore do not grieve at what they do:</AYA>
		<AYA id="011037">And make the ark before Our eyes and (according to) Our revelation, and do not speak to Me in respect of those who are unjust; surely they shall be drowned.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011038">And he began to make the ark; and whenever the chiefs from among his people passed by him they laughed at him. He said: If you laugh at us, surely we too laugh at you as you laugh (at us).</AYA>
		<AYA id="011039">So shall you know who it is on whom will come a chastisement which will disgrace him, and on whom will lasting chastisement come down.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011040">Until when Our command came and water came forth from the valley, We said: Carry in it two of all things, a pair, and your own family-- except those against whom the word has already gone forth, and those who believe. And there believed not with him but a few.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011041">And he said: Embark in it, in the name of Allah be its sailing and its anchoring; most surely my Lord is Forgiving, Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011042">And it moved on with them amid waves like mountains; and Nuh called out to his son, and he was aloof: O my son! embark with us and be not with the unbelievers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011043">He said: I will betake myself for refuge to a mountain that shall protect me from the water. Nuh said: There is no protector today from Allah's punishment but He Who has mercy; and a wave intervened between them, so he was of the drowned.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011044">And it was said: O earth, swallow down your water, and O cloud, clear away; and the water was made to abate and the affair was decided, and the ark rested on the Judi, and it was said: Away with the unjust people.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011045">And Nuh cried out to his Lord and said: My Lord! surely my son is of my family, and Thy promise is surely true, and Thou art the most just of the judges.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011046">He said: O Nuh! surely he is not of your family; surely he is (the doer of) other than good deeds, therefore ask not of Me that of which you have no knowledge; surely I admonish you lest you may be of the ignorant</AYA>
		<AYA id="011047">He said: My Lord! I seek refuge in Thee from asking Thee that of which I have no knowledge; and if Thou shouldst not forgive me and have mercy on me, I should be of the losers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011048">It was said: O Nuh! descend with peace from Us and blessings on you and on the people from among those who are with you, and there shall be nations whom We will afford provisions, then a painful punishment from Us shall afflict them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011049">These are announcements relating to the unseen which We reveal to you, you did not know them-- (neither) you nor your people-- before this; therefore be patient; surely the end is for those who guard (against evil).</AYA>
		<AYA id="011050">And to Ad (We sent) their brother Hud. He said: O my people! serve Allah, you have no god other than He; you are nothing but forgers (of lies).</AYA>
		<AYA id="011051">O my people! I do not ask of you any reward for it; my reward is only with Him Who created me; do you not then understand?</AYA>
		<AYA id="011052">And, O my people! ask forgiveness of your Lord, then turn to Him; He will send on you clouds pouring down abundance of rain and add strength to your strength, and do not turn back guilty.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011053">They said: O Hud! you have not brought to us any clear argument and we are not going to desert our gods for your word, and we are not believers in you:</AYA>
		<AYA id="011054">We cannot say aught but that some of our gods have smitten you with evil. He said: Surely I call Allah to witness, and do you bear witness too, that I am clear of what you associate (with Allah).</AYA>
		<AYA id="011055">Besides Him, therefore scheme against me all together; then give me no respite</AYA>
		<AYA id="011056">Surely I rely on Allah, my Lord and your Lord; there is no living creature but He holds it by its forelock; surely my Lord is on the right path.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011057">But if you turn back, then indeed I have delivered to you the message with which I have been sent to you, and my Lord will bring another people in your place, and you cannot do Him any harm; surely my Lord is the Preserver of all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011058">And when Our decree came to pass, We delivered Hud and those who believed with him with mercy from Us, and We delivered them from a hard chastisement.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011059">And this was Ad; they denied the communications of their Lord, and disobeyed His apostles and followed the bidding of every insolent opposer (of truth).</AYA>
		<AYA id="011060">And they were overtaken by curse in this world and on the resurrection day; now surely Ad disbelieved in their Lord; now surely, away with Ad, the people of Hud</AYA>
		<AYA id="011061">And to Samood (We sent) their brother Salih. He said: O my people! serve Allah, you have no god other than He; He brought you into being from the earth, and made you dwell in it, therefore ask forgiveness of Him, then turn to Him; surely my Lord is Nigh, Answering.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011062">They said: O Salih! surely you were one amongst us in whom great expectations were placed before this; do you (now) forbid us from worshipping what our fathers worshipped? And as to that which you call us to, most surely we are in disquieting doubt.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011063">He said: O my people! tell me if I have clear proof from my Lord and He has granted to me mercy from Himself-- who will then help me against Allah if I disobey Him? Therefore you do not add to me other than loss:</AYA>
		<AYA id="011064">And, O my people! this will be (as) Allah's she-camel for you, a sign; therefore leave her to pasture on Allah's earth and do not touch her with evil, for then a near chastisement will overtake you.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011065">But they slew her, so he said: Enjoy yourselves in your abode for three days, that is a promise not to be belied.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011066">So when Our decree came to pass, We delivered Salih and those who believed with him by mercy from Us, and (We saved them) from the disgrace of that day; surely your Lord is the Strong, the Mighty.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011067">And the rumbling overtook those who were unjust, so they became motionless bodies in their abodes,</AYA>
		<AYA id="011068">As though they had never dwelt in them; now surely did Samood disbelieve in their Lord; now surely, away with Samood.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011069">And certainly Our messengers came to Ibrahim with good news. They said: Peace. Peace, said he, and he made no delay in bringing a roasted calf.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011070">But when he saw that their hands were not extended towards it, he deemed them strange and conceived fear of them. . They said: Fear not, surely we are sent to Lut's people.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011071">And his wife was standing (by), so she laughed, then We gave her the good news of Ishaq and after Ishaq of (a son's son) Yaqoub.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011072">She said: O wonder! shall I bear a son when I am an extremely old woman and this my husband an extremely old man? Most surely this is a wonderful thing.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011073">They said: Do you wonder at Allah's bidding? The mercy of Allah and His blessings are on you, O people of the house, surely He is Praised, Glorious.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011074">So when fear had gone away from Ibrahim and good news came to him, he began to plead with Us for Lut's people.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011075">Most surely Ibrahim was forbearing, tender-hearted, oft-returning (to Allah):</AYA>
		<AYA id="011076">O Ibrahim! leave off this, surely the decree of your Lord has come to pass, and surely there must come to them a chastisement that cannot be averted.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011077">And when Our messengers came to Lut, he was grieved for them, and he lacked strength to protect them, and said: This is a hard day.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011078">And his people came to him, (as if) rushed on towards him, and already they did evil deeds. He said: O my people! these are my daughters-- they are purer for you, so guard against (the punishment of) Allah and do not disgrace me with regard to my guests; is there not among you one right-minded man?</AYA>
		<AYA id="011079">They said: Certainly you know that we have no claim on your daughters, and most surely you know what we desire.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011080">He said: Ah! that I had power to suppress you, rather I shall have recourse to a strong support.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011081">They said: O Lut! we are the messengers of your Lord; they shall by no means reach you; so remove your followers in a part of the night-- and let none of you turn back-- except your wife, for surely whatsoever befalls them shall befall her; surely their appointed time is the morning; is not the morning nigh?</AYA>
		<AYA id="011082">So when Our decree came to pass, We turned them upside down and rained down upon them stones, of what had been decreed, one after another.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011083">Marked (for punishment) with your Lord and it is not far off from the unjust.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011084">And to Madyan (We sent) their brother Shu'aib. He said: O my people! serve Allah, you have no god other than He, and do not give short measure and weight: surely I see you in prosperity and surely I fear for you the punishment of an all-encompassing day.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011085">And, O my people! give full measure and weight fairly, and defraud not men their things, and do not act corruptly in the land, making mischief:</AYA>
		<AYA id="011086">What remains with Allah is better for you if you are believers, and I am not a keeper over you.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011087">They said: O Shu'aib! does your prayer enjoin you that we should forsake what our fathers worshipped or that we should not do what we please with regard to our property? Forsooth you are the forbearing, the right-directing one.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011088">He said: O my people! have you considered if I have a clear proof from my Lord and He has given me a goodly sustenance from Himself, and I do not desire that in opposition to you I should betake myself to that which I forbid you: I desire nothing but reform so far as I am able, and with none but Allah is the direction of my affair to a right issue; on Him do I rely and to Him do I turn:</AYA>
		<AYA id="011089">And, O my people! let not opposition to me make you guilty so that there may befall you the like of what befell the people of Nuh, or the people of Hud, or the people of Salih, nor are the people of Lut far off from you;</AYA>
		<AYA id="011090">And ask forgiveness of your Lord, then turn to Him; surely my Lord is Merciful, Loving-kind.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011091">They said: O Shu'aib! we do not understand much of what you say and most surely we see you to be weak among us, and were it not for your family we would surely stone you, and you are not mighty against us.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011092">He said: O my people! is my family more esteemed by you than Allah? And you neglect Him as a thing cast behind your back; surely my Lord encompasses what you do:</AYA>
		<AYA id="011093">And, O my people! act according to your ability, I too am acting; you will come to know soon who it is on whom will light the punishment that will disgrace him and who it is that is a liar, and watch, surely I too am watching with you.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011094">And when Our decree came to pass We delivered Shu'aib, and those who believed with him by mercy from Us, and the rumbling overtook those who were unjust so they became motionless bodies in their abodes,</AYA>
		<AYA id="011095">As though they had never dwelt in them; now surely perdition overtook Madyan as had perished Samood.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011096">And certainly We sent Musa with Our communications and a clear authority,</AYA>
		<AYA id="011097">To Firon and his chiefs, but they followed the bidding of Firon, and Firon's bidding was not right-directing.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011098">He shall lead his people on the resurrection day, and bring them down to the fire; and evil the place to which they are brought.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011099">And they are overtaken by curse in this (world), and on the resurrection day, evil the gift which shall be given.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011100">This is an account of (the fate of) the towns which We relate to you; of them are some that stand and (others) mown down.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011101">And We did not do them injustice, but they were unjust to themselves, so their gods whom they called upon besides Allah did not avail them aught when the decree of your Lord came to pass; and they added but to their ruin.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011102">And such is the punishment of your Lord when He punishes the towns while they are unjust; surely His punishment is painful, severe.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011103">Most surely there is a sign in this for him who fears the chastisement of the hereafter; this is a day on which the people shall be gathered together and this is a day that shall be witnessed.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011104">And We do not delay it but to an appointed term.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011105">On the day when it shall come, no soul shall speak except with His permission, then (some) of them shall be unhappy and (others) happy.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011106">So as to those who are unhappy, they shall be in the fire; for them shall be sighing and groaning in it:</AYA>
		<AYA id="011107">Abiding therein so long as the heavens and the earth endure, except as your Lord please; surely your Lord is the mighty doer of what He intends.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011108">And as to those who are made happy, they shall be in the garden, abiding in it as long as the heavens and the earth endure, except as your Lord please; a gift which shall never be cut off.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011109">Therefore be not in doubt as to what these worship; they do not worship but as their fathers worshipped before; and most surely We will pay them back in full their portion undiminished.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011110">And certainly We gave the book to Musa, but it was gone against; and had not a word gone forth from your Lord, the matter would surely have been decided between them; and surely they are in a disquieting doubt about it.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011111">And your Lord will most surely pay back to all their deeds in full; surely He is aware of what they do.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011112">Continue then in the right way as you are commanded, as also he who has turned (to Allah) with you, and be not inordinate (O men!), surely He sees what you do.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011113">And do not incline to those who are unjust, lest the fire touch you, and you have no guardians besides Allah, then you shall not be helped.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011114">And keep up prayer in the two parts of the day and in the first hours of the night; surely good deeds take away evil deeds this is a reminder to the mindful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011115">And be patient, for surely Allah does not waste the reward of the good-doers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011116">But why were there not among the generations before you those possessing understanding, who should have forbidden the making of mischief in the earth, except a few of those whom We delivered from among them? And those who were unjust went after what they are made to enjoy of plenty, and they were guilty.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011117">And it did not beseem your Lord to have destroyed the towns tyrannously, while their people acted well.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011118">And if your Lord had pleased He would certainly have made people a single nation, and they shall continue to differ.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011119">Except those on whom your Lord has mercy; and for this did He create them; and the word of your Lord is fulfilled: Certainly I will fill hell with the jinn and the men, all together.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011120">And all we relate to you of the accounts of the apostles is to strengthen your heart therewith; and in this has come to you the truth and an admonition, and a reminder to the believers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011121">And say to those who do not believe: Act according to your state; surely we too are acting.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011122">And wait; surely we are waiting also.</AYA>
		<AYA id="011123">And Allah's is the unseen in the heavens and the earth, and to Him is returned the whole of the affair; therefore serve Him and rely on Him, and your Lord is not heedless of what you do.</AYA>

	<SOURA id="12" name="Yusuf">
		<AYA id="012001">Alif Lam Ra. These are the verses of the Book that makes (things) manifest.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012002">Surely We have revealed it-- an Arabic Quran-- that you may understand.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012003">We narrate to you the best of narratives, by Our revealing to you this Quran, though before this you were certainly one of those who did not know.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012004">When Yusuf said to his father: O my father! surely I saw eleven stars and the sun and the moon-- I saw them making obeisance to me.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012005">He said: O my son! do not relate your vision to your brothers, lest they devise a plan against you; surely the Shaitan is an open enemy to man.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012006">And thus will your Lord choose you and teach you the interpretation of sayings and make His favor complete to you and to the children of Yaqoub, as He made it complete before to your fathers, Ibrahim and Ishaq; surely your Lord is Knowing, Wise.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012007">Certainly in Yusuf and his brothers there are signs for the inquirers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012008">When they said: Certainly Yusuf and his brother are dearer to our father than we, though we are a (stronger) company; most surely our father is in manifest error:</AYA>
		<AYA id="012009">Slay Yusuf or cast him (forth) into some land, so that your father's regard may be exclusively for you, and after that you may be a righteous people.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012010">A speaker from among them said: Do not slay Yusuf, and cast him down into the bottom of the pit if you must do (it), (so that) some of the travellers may pick him up.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012011">They said: O our father! what reason have you that you do not trust in us with respect to Yusuf? And most surely we are his sincere well-wishers:</AYA>
		<AYA id="012012">Send him with us tomorrow that he may enjoy himself and sport, and surely we will guard him well.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012013">He said: Surely it grieves me that you should take him off, and I fear lest the wolf devour him while you are heedless of him.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012014">They said: Surely if the wolf should devour him notwithstanding that we are a (strong) company, we should then certainly be losers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012015">So when they had gone off with him and agreed that they should put him down at the bottom of the pit, and We revealed to him: You will most certainly inform them of this their affair while they do not perceive.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012016">And they came to their father at nightfall, weeping.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012017">They said: O our father! surely we went off racing and left Yusuf by our goods, so the wolf devoured him, and you will not believe us though we are truthful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012018">And they brought his shirt with false blood upon it. He said: Nay, your souls have made the matter light for you, but patience is good and Allah is He Whose help is sought for against what you describe.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012019">And there came travellers and they sent their water-drawer and he let down his bucket. He said: O good news! this is a youth; and they concealed him as an article of merchandise, and Allah knew what they did.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012020">And they sold him for a small price, a few pieces of silver, and they showed no desire for him.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012021">And the Egyptian who bought him said to his wife: Give him an honorable abode, maybe he will be useful to us, or we may adopt him as a son. And thus did We establish Yusuf in the land and that We might teach him the interpretation of sayings; and Allah is the master of His affair, but most people do not know.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012022">And when he had attained his maturity, We gave him wisdom and knowledge: and thus do We reward those who do good.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012023">And she in whose house he was sought to make himself yield (to her), and she made fast the doors and said: Come forward. He said: I seek Allah's refuge, surely my Lord made good my abode: Surely the unjust do not prosper.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012024">And certainly she made for him, and he would have made for her, were it not that he had seen the manifest evidence of his Lord; thus (it was) that We might turn away from him evil and indecency, surely he was one of Our sincere servants.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012025">And they both hastened to the door, and she rent his shirt from behind and they met her husband at the door. She said: What is the punishment of him who intends evil to your wife except imprisonment or a painful chastisement?</AYA>
		<AYA id="012026">He said: She sought to make me yield (to her); and a witness of her own family bore witness: If his shirt is rent from front, she speaks the truth and he is one of the liars:</AYA>
		<AYA id="012027">And if his shirt is rent from behind, she tells a lie and he is one of the truthful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012028">So when he saw his shirt rent from behind, he said: Surely it is a guile of you women; surely your guile is great:</AYA>
		<AYA id="012029">O Yusuf! turn aside from this; and (O my wife)! ask forgiveness for your fault, surely you are one of the wrong-doers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012030">And women in the city said: The chiefs wife seeks her slave to yield himself (to her), surely he has affected her deeply with (his) love; most surely we see her in manifest error.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012031">So when she heard of their sly talk she sent for them and prepared for them a repast, and gave each of them a knife, and said (to Yusuf): Come forth to them. So when they saw him, they deemed him great, and cut their hands (in amazement), and said: Remote is Allah (from inperfection); this is not a mortal; this is but a noble angel.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012032">She said: This is he with respect to whom you blamed me, and certainly I sought his yielding himself (to me), but he abstained, and if he does not do what I bid him, he shall certainly be imprisoned, and he shall certainly be of those who are in a state of ignominy.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012033">He said: My Lord! the prison house is dearer to me than that to which they invite me; and if Thou turn not away their device from me, I will yearn towards them and become (one) of the ignorant.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012034">Thereupon his Lord accepted his prayer and turned away their guile from him; surely He is the Hearing, the Knowing.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012035">Then it occurred to them after they had seen the signs that they should imprison him till a time.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012036">And two youths entered the prison with him. One of them said: I saw myself pressing wine. And the other said: I saw myself carrying bread on my head, of which birds ate. Inform us of its interpretation; surely we see you to be of the doers of good.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012037">He said: There shall not come to you the food with which you are fed, but I will inform you both of its interpretation before it comes to you; this is of what my Lord has taught me; surely I have forsaken the religion of a people who do not believe in Allah, and they are deniers of the hereafter:</AYA>
		<AYA id="012038">And I follow the religion of my fathers, Ibrahim and Ishaq and Yaqoub; it beseems us not that we should associate aught with Allah; this is by Allah's grace upon us and on mankind, but most people do not give thanks:</AYA>
		<AYA id="012039">O my two mates of the prison! are sundry lords better or Allah the One, the Supreme?</AYA>
		<AYA id="012040">You do not serve besides Him but names which you have named, you and your fathers; Allah has not sent down any authority for them; judgment is only Allah's; He has commanded that you shall not serve aught but Him; this is the right religion but most people do not know:</AYA>
		<AYA id="012041">O my two mates of the prison! as for one of you, he shall give his lord to drink wine; and as for the other, he shall be crucified, so that the birds shall eat from his head, the matter is decreed concerning which you inquired.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012042">And he said to him whom he knew would be delivered of the two: Remember me with your lord; but the Shaitan caused him to forget mentioning (it) to his lord, so he remained in the prison a few years.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012043">And the king said: Surely I see seven fat kine which seven lean ones devoured; and seven green ears and (seven) others dry: O chiefs! explain to me my dream, if you can interpret the dream.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012044">They said: Confused dreams, and we do not know.the interpretation of dreams.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012045">And of the two (prisoners) he who had found deliverance and remembered after a long time said: I will inform you of its interpretation, so let me go:</AYA>
		<AYA id="012046">Yusuf! O truthful one! explain to us seven fat kine which seven lean ones devoured, and seven green ears and (seven) others dry, that I may go back to the people so that they may know.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012047">He said: You shall sow for seven years continuously, then what you reap leave it in its ear except a little of which you eat.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012048">Then there shall come after that seven years of hardship which shall eat away all that you have beforehand laid up in store for them, except a little of what you shall have preserved:</AYA>
		<AYA id="012049">Then there will come after that a year in which people shall have rain and in which they shall press (grapes).</AYA>
		<AYA id="012050">And the king said: Bring him to me. So when the messenger came to him, he said: Go back to your lord and ask him, what is the case of the women who cut their hands; surely my Lord knows their guile.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012051">He said: How was your affair when you sought Yusuf to yield himself (to you)? They said: Remote is Allah (from imperfection), we knew of no evil on his part. The chief's wife said: Now has the truth become established: I sought him to yield himself (to me), and he is most surely of the truthful ones.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012052">This is that he might know that I have not been unfaithful to him in secret and that Allah does not guide the device of the unfaithful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012053">And I do not declare myself free, most surely (man's) self is wont to command (him to do) evil, except such as my Lord has had mercy on, surely my Lord is Forgiving, Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012054">And the king said: Bring him to me, I will choose him for myself. So when he had spoken with him, he said: Surely you are in our presence today an honorable, a faithful one.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012055">He said: Place me (in authority) over the treasures of the land, surely I am a good keeper, knowing well.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012056">And thus did We give to Yusuf power in the land-- he had mastery in it wherever he liked; We send down Our mercy on whom We please, and We do not waste the reward of those who do good.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012057">And certainly the reward of the hereafter is much better for those who believe and guard (against evil).</AYA>
		<AYA id="012058">And Yusuf's brothers came and went in to him, and he knew them, while they did not recognize him.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012059">And when he furnished them with their provision, he said: Bring to me a brother of yours from your father; do you not see that I give full measure and that I am the best of hosts?</AYA>
		<AYA id="012060">But if you do not bring him to me, you shall have no measure (of corn) from me, nor shall you come near me.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012061">They said: We will strive to make his father yield in respect of him, and we are sure to do (it).</AYA>
		<AYA id="012062">And he said to his servants: Put their money into their bags that they may recognize it when they go back to their family, so that they may come back.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012063">So when they returned to their father, they said: O our father, the measure is withheld from us, therefore send with us our brother, (so that) we may get the measure, and we will most surely guard him.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012064">He said: I cannot trust in you with respect to him, except as I trusted in you with respect to his brother before; but Allah is the best Keeper, and He is the most Merciful of the merciful ones.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012065">And when they opened their goods, they found their money returned to them. They said: O our father! what (more) can we desire? This is our property returned to us, and we will bring corn for our family and guard our brother, and will have in addition the measure of a camel (load); this is an easy measure.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012066">He said: I will by no means send him with you until you give me a firm covenant in Allah's name that you will most certainly bring him back to me, unless you are completely surrounded. And when they gave him their covenant, he said: Allah is the One in Whom trust is placed as regards what we say.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012067">And he said: O my sons ! do not (all) enter by one gate and enter by different gates and I cannot avail you aught against Allah; judgment is only Allah's; on Him do I rely, and on Him let those who are reliant rely.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012068">And when they had entered as their father had bidden them, it did not avail them aught against Allah, but (it was only) a desire in the soul of Yaqoub which he satisfied; and surely he was possessed of knowledge because We had given him knowledge, but most people do not know.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012069">And when they went in to Yusuf. he lodged his brother with himself, saying: I am your brother, therefore grieve not at what they do.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012070">So when he furnished them with their provisions, (someone) placed the drinking cup in his brother's bag. Then a crier cried out: O caravan! you are most surely thieves.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012071">They said while they were facing them: What is it that you miss?</AYA>
		<AYA id="012072">They said: We miss the king's drinking cup, and he who shall bring it shall have a camel-load and I am responsible for it.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012073">They said: By Allah! you know for certain that we have not come to make mischief in the land, and we are not thieves.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012074">They said: But what shall be the requital of this, if you are liars?</AYA>
		<AYA id="012075">They said: The requital of this is that the person in whose bag it is found shall himself be (held for) the satisfaction thereof; thus do we punish the wrongdoers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012076">So he began with their sacks before the sack of his brother, then he brought it out from his brother's sack. Thus did We plan for the sake of Yusuf; it was not (lawful) that he should take his brother under the king's law unless Allah pleased; We raise the degrees of whomsoever We please, and above every one possessed of knowledge is the All-knowing one.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012077">They said: If he steal, a brother of his did indeed steal before; but Yusuf kept it secret in his heart and did not disclose it to them. He said: You are in an evil condition and Allah knows best what you state.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012078">They said: O chief! he has a father, a very old man, therefore retain one of us in his stead; surely we see you to be of the doers of good.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012079">He said: Allah protect us that we should seize other than him with whom we found our property, for then most surely we would be unjust.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012080">Then when they despaired of him, they retired, conferring privately together. The eldest of them said: Do you not know that your father took from you a covenant in Allah's name, and how you fell short of your duty with respect to Yusuf before? Therefore I will by no means depart from this land until my father permits me or Allah decides for me, and He is the best of the judges:</AYA>
		<AYA id="012081">Go back to your father and say: O our father! surely your son committed theft, and we do not bear witness except to what we have known, and we could not keep watch over the unseen:</AYA>
		<AYA id="012082">And inquire in the town in which we were and the caravan with which we proceeded, and most surely we are truthful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012083">He (Yaqoub) said: Nay, your souls have made a matter light for you, so patience is good; maybe Allah will bring them all together to me; surely He is the Knowing, the Wise.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012084">And he turned away from them, and said: O my sorrow for Yusuf! and his eyes became white on account of the grief, and he was a repressor (of grief).</AYA>
		<AYA id="012085">They said: By Allah! you will not cease to remember Yusuf until you are a prey to constant disease or (until) you are of those who perish.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012086">He said: I only complain of my grief and sorrow to Allah, and I know from Allah what you do not know.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012087">O my sons! Go and inquire respecting Yusuf and his brother, and despair not of Allah's mercy; surely none despairs of Allah's mercy except the unbelieving people.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012088">So when they came in to him, they said: O chief! distress has afflicted us and our family and we have brought scanty money, so give us full measure and be charitable to us; surely Allah rewards the charitable.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012089">He said: Do you know how you treated Yusuf and his brother when you were ignorant?</AYA>
		<AYA id="012090">They said: Are you indeed Yusuf? He said: I am Yusuf and this is my brother; Allah has indeed been gracious to us; surely he who guards (against evil) and is patient (is rewarded) for surely Allah does not waste the reward of those who do good.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012091">They said: By Allah! now has Allah certainly chosen you over us, and we were certainly sinners.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012092">He said: (There shall be) no reproof against you this day; Allah may forgive you, and He is the most Merciful of the merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012093">Take this my shirt and cast it on my father's face, he will (again) be able to see, and come to me with all your families.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012094">And when the caravan had departed, their father said: Most surely I perceive the greatness of Yusuf, unless you pronounce me to be weak in judgment.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012095">They said: By Allah, you are most surely in your old error.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012096">So when the bearer of good news came he cast it on his face, so forthwith he regained his sight. He said: Did I not say to you that I know from Allah what you do not know?</AYA>
		<AYA id="012097">They said: O our father! ask forgiveness of our faults for us, surely we were sinners.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012098">He said: I will ask for you forgiveness from my Lord; surely He is the Forgiving, the Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012099">Then when they came in to Yusuf, he took his parents to lodge with him and said: Enter safe into Egypt, if Allah please.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012100">And he raised his parents upon the throne and they fell down in prostration before him, and he said: O my father! this is the significance of my vision of old; my Lord has indeed made it to be true; and He was indeed kind to me when He brought me forth from the prison and brought you from the desert after the Shaitan had sown dissensions between me and my brothers, surely my Lord is benignant to whom He pleases; surely He is the Knowing, the Wise.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012101">My Lord! Thou hast given me of the kingdom and taught me of the interpretation of sayings: Originator of the heavens and the earth! Thou art my guardian in this world and the hereafter; make me die a muslim and join me with the good.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012102">This is of the announcements relating to the unseen (which) We reveal to you, and you were not with them when they resolved upon their affair, and they were devising plans.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012103">And most men will not believe though you desire it eagerly.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012104">And you do not ask them for a reward for this; it is nothing but a reminder for all mankind</AYA>
		<AYA id="012105">And how many a sign in the heavens and the earth which they pass by, yet they turn aside from it.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012106">And most of them do not believe in Allah without associating others (with Him).</AYA>
		<AYA id="012107">Do they then feel secure that there may come to them an extensive chastisement from Allah or (that) the hour may come to them suddenly while they do not perceive?</AYA>
		<AYA id="012108">Say: This is my way: I call to Allah, I and those who follow me being certain, and glory be to Allah, and I am not one of the polytheists.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012109">And We have not sent before you but men from (among) the people of the towns, to whom We sent revelations. Have they not then travelled in the land and seen what was the end of those before them? And certainly the abode of the hereafter is best for those who guard (against evil); do you not then understand?</AYA>
		<AYA id="012110">Until when the apostles despaired and the people became sure that they were indeed told a lie, Our help came to them and whom We pleased was delivered; and Our punishment is not averted from the guilty people.</AYA>
		<AYA id="012111">In their histories there is certainly a lesson for men of understanding. It is not a narrative which could be forged, but a verification of what is before it and a distinct explanation of all things and a guide and a mercy to a people who believe.</AYA>
	</SOURA>


	<SOURA id="13" name="The Thunder">
		<AYA id="013001">Alif Lam Mim Ra. These are the verses of the Book; and that which is revealed to you from your Lord is the truth, but most people do not believe.</AYA>
		<AYA id="013002">Allah is He Who raised the heavens without any pillars that you see, and He is firm in power and He made the sun and the moon subservient (to you); each one pursues its course to an appointed time; He regulates the affair, making clear the signs that you may be certain of meeting your Lord.</AYA>
		<AYA id="013003">And He it is Who spread the earth and made in it firm mountains and rivers, and of all fruits He has made in it two kinds; He makes the night cover the day; most surely there are signs in this for a people who reflect.</AYA>
		<AYA id="013004">And in the earth there are tracts side by side and gardens of grapes and corn and palm trees having one root and (others) having distinct roots-- they are watered with one water, and We make some of them excel others in fruit; most surely there are signs in this for a people who understand.</AYA>
		<AYA id="013005">And if you would wonder, then wondrous is their saying: What! when we are dust, shall we then certainly be in a new creation? These are they who disbelieve in their Lord, and these have chains on their necks, and they are the inmates of the fire; in it they shall abide.</AYA>
		<AYA id="013006">And they ask you to hasten on the evil before the good, and indeed there have been exemplary punishments before them; and most surely your Lord is the Lord of forgiveness to people, notwithstanding their injustice; and most surely your Lord is severe in requiting (evil).</AYA>
		<AYA id="013007">And those who disbelieve say: Why has not a sign been sent down upon him from his Lord? You are only a warner and (there is) a guide for every people.</AYA>
		<AYA id="013008">Allah knows what every female bears, and that of which the wombs fall short of completion and that in which they increase; and there is a measure with Him of everything.</AYA>
		<AYA id="013009">The knower of the unseen and the seen, the Great, the Most High.</AYA>
		<AYA id="013010">Alike (to Him) among you is he who conceals (his) words and he who speaks them openly, and he who hides himself by night and (who) goes forth by day.</AYA>
		<AYA id="013011">For his sake there are angels following one another, before him and behind him, who guard him by Allah's commandment; surely Allah does not change the condition of a people until they change their own condition; and when Allah intends evil to a people, there is no averting it, and besides Him they have no protector.</AYA>
		<AYA id="013012">He it is Who shows you the lightning causing fear and hope and (Who) brings up the heavy cloud.</AYA>
		<AYA id="013013">And the thunder declares His glory with His praise, and the angels too for awe of Him; and He sends the thunderbolts and smites with them whom He pleases, yet they dispute concerning Allah, and He is mighty in prowess.</AYA>
		<AYA id="013014">To Him is due the true prayer; and those whom they pray to besides Allah give them no answer, but (they are) like one who stretches forth his two hands towards water that it may reach his mouth, but it will not reach it; and the prayer of the unbelievers is only in error.</AYA>
		<AYA id="013015">And whoever is in the heavens and the earth makes obeisance to Allah only, willingly and unwillingly, and their shadows too at morn and eve.</AYA>
		<AYA id="013016">Say: Who is the Lord of the heavens and the earth?-- Say: Allah. Say: Do you take then besides Him guardians who do not control any profit or harm for themselves? Say: Are the blind and the seeing alike? Or can the darkness and the light be equal? Or have they set up with Allah associates who have created creation like His, so that what is created became confused to them? Say: Allah is the Creator of all things, and He is the One, the Supreme.</AYA>
		<AYA id="013017">He sends down water from the cloud, then watercourses flow (with water) according to their measure, and the torrent bears along the swelling foam, and from what they melt in the fire for the sake of making ornaments or apparatus arises a scum like it; thus does Allah compare truth and falsehood; then as for the scum, it passes away as a worthless thing; and as for that which profits the people, it tarries in the earth; thus does Allah set forth parables.</AYA>
		<AYA id="013018">For those who respond to their Lord is good; and (as for) those who do not respond to Him, had they all that is in the earth and the like thereof with it they would certainly offer it for a ransom. (As for) those, an evil reckoning shall be theirs and their abode is hell, and evil is the resting-place.</AYA>
		<AYA id="013019">Is he then who knows that what has been revealed to you from your Lord is the truth like him who is blind? Only those possessed of understanding will mind,</AYA>
		<AYA id="013020">Those who fulfil the promise of Allah and do not break the covenant,</AYA>
		<AYA id="013021">And those who join that which Allah has bidden to be joined and have awe of their Lord and fear the evil reckoning.</AYA>
		<AYA id="013022">And those who are constant, seeking the pleasure of their Lord, and keep up prayer and spend (benevolently) out of what We have given them secretly and openly and repel evil with good; as for those, they shall have the (happy) issue of the abode</AYA>
		<AYA id="013023">The gardens of perpetual abode which they will enter along with those who do good from among their parents and their spouses and their offspring; and the angels will enter in upon them from every gate:</AYA>
		<AYA id="013024">Peace be on you because you were constant, how excellent, is then, the issue of the abode.</AYA>
		<AYA id="013025">And those who break the covenant of Allah after its confirmation and cut asunder that which Allah has ordered to be joined and make mischief in the land; (as for) those, upon them shall be curse and they shall have the evil (issue) of the abode.</AYA>
		<AYA id="013026">Allah amplifies and straitens the means of subsistence for whom He pleases; and they rejoice in this world's life, and this world's life is nothing compared with the hereafter but a temporary enjoyment.</AYA>
		<AYA id="013027">And those who disbelieve say: Why is not a sign sent down upon him by his Lord? Say: Surely Allah makes him who will go astray, and guides to Himself those who turn (to Him).</AYA>
		<AYA id="013028">Those who believe and whose hearts are set at rest by the remembrance of Allah; now surely by Allah's remembrance are the hearts set at rest.</AYA>
		<AYA id="013029">(As for) those who believe and do good, a good final state shall be theirs and a goodly return.</AYA>
		<AYA id="013030">And thus We have sent you among a nation before which other nations have passed away, that you might recite to them what We have revealed to you and (still) they deny the Beneficent God. Say: He is my Lord, there is no god but He; on Him do I rely and to Him is my return.</AYA>
		<AYA id="013031">And even if there were a Quran with which the mountains were made to pass away, or the earth were travelled over with it, or the dead were made to speak thereby; nay! the commandment is wholly Allah's, Have not yet those who believe known that if Allah please He would certainly guide all the people? And (as for) those who disbelieve, there will not cease to afflict them because of what they do a repelling calamity, or it will alight close by their abodes, until the promise of Allah comes about; surely Allah will not fail in (His) promise.</AYA>
		<AYA id="013032">And apostles before you were certainly mocked at, but I gave respite to those who disbelieved, then I destroyed them; how then was My requital (of evil)?</AYA>
		<AYA id="013033">Is He then Who watches every soul as to what it earns? And yet they give associates to Allah! Say: Give them a name; nay, do you mean to inform Him of what He does not know in the earth, or (do you affirm this) by an outward saying? Rather, their plans are made to appear fair-seeming to those who disbelieve, and they are kept back from the path; and whom Allah makes err, he shall have no guide.</AYA>
		<AYA id="013034">They shall have chastisement in this world's life, and the chastisement of the hereafter is certainly more grievous, and they shall have no protector against Allah.</AYA>
		<AYA id="013035">A likeness of the garden which the righteous are promised; there now beneath it rivers, its food and shades are perpetual; this is the requital of those who guarded (against evil), and the requital of the unbelievers is the fire.</AYA>
		<AYA id="013036">And those to whom We have given the Book rejoice in that which has been revealed to you, and of the confederates are some who deny a part of it. Say: I am only commanded that I should serve Allah and not associate anything with Him, to Him do I invite (you) and to Him is my return.</AYA>
		<AYA id="013037">And thus have We revealed it, a true judgment in Arabic, and if you follow their low desires after what has come to you of knowledge, you shall not have against Allah any guardian or a protector.</AYA>

	<SOURA id="14" name="Ibrahim">
		<AYA id="014001">Alif Lam Ra. (This is) a Book which We have revealed to you that you may bring forth men, by their Lord's permission from utter darkness into light-- to the way of the Mighty, the Praised One,</AYA>
		<AYA id="014002">(Of) Allah, Whose is whatever is in the heavens and whatever Is in the earth; and woe to the unbelievers on account of the severe chastisement,</AYA>
		<AYA id="014003">(To) those who love this world's life more than the hereafter, and turn away from Allah's path and desire to make it crooked; these are in a great error.</AYA>
		<AYA id="014004">And We did not send any apostle but with the language of his people, so that he might explain to them clearly; then Allah makes whom He pleases err and He guides whom He pleases and He is the Mighty, the Wise.</AYA>
		<AYA id="014005">And certainly We sent Musa with Our communications, saying: Bring forth your people from utter darkness into light and remind them of the days of Allah; most surely there are signs in this for every patient, grateful one.</AYA>
		<AYA id="014006">And when Musa said to his people: Call to mind Allah's favor to you when He delivered you from Firon's people, who subjected you to severe torment, and slew your sons and spared your women; and in this there was a great trial from your Lord.</AYA>
		<AYA id="014007">And when your Lord made it known: If you are grateful, I would certainly give to you more, and if you are ungrateful, My chastisement is truly severe.</AYA>
		<AYA id="014008">And Musa said: If you are ungrateful, you and those on earth all together, most surely Allah is Self-sufficient, Praised;</AYA>
		<AYA id="014009">Has not the account reached you of those before you, of the people of Nuh and Ad and Samood, and those after them? None knows them but Allah. Their apostles come to them with clear arguments, but they thrust their hands into their mouths and said: Surely we deny that with which you are sent, and most surely we are in serious doubt as to that to which you invite us.</AYA>
		<AYA id="014010">Their apostles said: Is there doubt about Allah, the Maker of the heavens and the earth? He invites you to forgive you your faults and to respite you till an appointed term. They said: You are nothing but mortals like us; you wish to turn us away from what our fathers used to worship; bring us therefore some clear authority.</AYA>
		<AYA id="014011">Their apostles said to them: We are nothing but mortals like yourselves, but Allah bestows (His) favors on whom He pleases of His servants, and it is not for us that we should bring you an authority except by Allah's permission; and on Allah should the believers rely.</AYA>
		<AYA id="014012">And what reason have we that we should not rely on Allah? And He has indeed guided us in our ways; and certainly we would bear with patience your persecution of us; and on Allah should the reliant rely.</AYA>
		<AYA id="014013">And those who disbelieved said to their apostles: We will most certainly drive you forth from our land, or else you shall come back into our religion. So their Lord revealed to them: Most certainly We will destroy the unjust.</AYA>
		<AYA id="014014">And most certainly We will settle you in the land after them; this is for him who fears standing in My presence and who fears My threat.</AYA>
		<AYA id="014015">And they asked for judgment and every insolent opposer was disappointed:</AYA>
		<AYA id="014016">Hell is before him and he shall be given to drink of festering water:</AYA>
		<AYA id="014017">He will drink it little by little and will not be able to swallow it agreeably, and death will come to him from every quarter, but he shall not die; and there shall be vehement chastisement before him.</AYA>
		<AYA id="014018">The parable of those who disbelieve in their Lord: their actions are like ashes on which the wind blows hard on a stormy day; they shall not have power over any thing out of what they have earned; this is the great error.</AYA>
		<AYA id="014019">Do you not see that Allah created the heavens and the earth with truth? If He please He will take you off and bring a new creation,</AYA>
		<AYA id="014020">And this is not difficult for Allah.</AYA>
		<AYA id="014021">And they shall all come forth before Allah, then the weak shall say to those who were proud: Surely we were your followers, can you therefore avert from us any part of the chastisement of Allah? They would say: If Allah had guided us, we too would have guided you; it is the same to us whether we are impatient (now) or patient, there is no place for us to fly to.</AYA>
		<AYA id="014022">And the Shaitan shall say after the affair is decided: Surely Allah promised you the promise of truth, and I gave you promises, then failed to keep them to you, and I had no authority over you, except that I called you and you obeyed me, therefore do not blame me but blame yourselves: I cannot be your aider (now) nor can you be my aiders; surely I disbelieved in your associating me with Allah before; surely it is the unjust that shall have the painful punishment.</AYA>
		<AYA id="014023">And those who believe and do good are made to enter gardens, beneath which rivers flow, to abide in them by their Lord's permission; their greeting therein is, Peace.</AYA>
		<AYA id="014024">Have you not considered how Allah sets forth a parable of a good word (being) like a good tree, whose root is firm and whose branches are in heaven,</AYA>
		<AYA id="014025">Yielding its fruit in every season by the permission of its Lord? And Allah sets forth parables for men that they may be mindful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="014026">And the parable of an evil word is as an evil tree pulled up from the earth's surface; it has no stability.</AYA>
		<AYA id="014027">Allah confirms those who believe with the sure word in this world's life and in the hereafter, and Allah causes the unjust to go astray, and Allah does what He pleases.</AYA>
		<AYA id="014028">Have you not seen those who have changed Allah's favor for ungratefulness and made their people to alight into the abode of perdition</AYA>
		<AYA id="014029">(Into j hell? They shall enter into it and an evil place it is to settle in.</AYA>
		<AYA id="014030">And they set up equals with Allah that they may lead (people) astray from His path. Say: Enjoy yourselves, for surely your return is to the fire.</AYA>
		<AYA id="014031">Say to My servants who believe that they should keep up prayer and spend out of what We have given them secretly and openly before the coming of the day in which there shall be no bartering nor mutual befriending.</AYA>
		<AYA id="014032">Allah is He Who created the heavens and the earth and sent down water from the clouds, then brought forth with it fruits as a sustenance for you, and He has made the ships subservient to you, that they might run their course in the sea by His command, and He has made the rivers subservient to you.</AYA>
		<AYA id="014033">And He has made subservient to you the sun and the moon pursuing their courses, and He has made subservient to you the night and the day.</AYA>
		<AYA id="014034">And He gives you of all that you ask Him; and if you count Allah's favors, you will not be able to number them; most surely man is very unjust, very ungrateful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="014035">And when Ibrahim said: My Lord! make this city secure, and save me and my sons from worshipping idols:</AYA>
		<AYA id="014036">My Lord! surely they have led many men astray; then whoever follows me, he is surely of me, and whoever disobeys me, Thou surely arc Forgiving, Merciful:</AYA>
		<AYA id="014037">O our Lord! surely I have settled a part of my offspring in a valley unproductive of fruit near Thy Sacred House, our Lord! that they may keep up prayer; therefore make the hearts of some people yearn towards them and provide them with fruits; haply they may be grateful:</AYA>
		<AYA id="014038">O our Lord! Surely Thou knowest what we hide and what we make public, and nothing in the earth nor any thing in heaven is hidden from Allah:</AYA>
		<AYA id="014039">Praise be to Allah, Who has given me in old age Ismail and Ishaq; most surely my Lord is the Hearer of prayer:</AYA>
		<AYA id="014040">My Lord! make me keep up prayer and from my offspring (too), O our Lord, and accept my prayer:</AYA>
		<AYA id="014041">O our Lord! grant me protection and my parents and the believers on the day when the reckoning shall come to pass!</AYA>
		<AYA id="014042">And do not think Allah to be heedless of what the unjust do; He only respites them to a day on which the eyes shall be fixedly open,</AYA>
		<AYA id="014043">Hastening forward, their heads upraised, their eyes not reverting to them and their hearts vacant.</AYA>
		<AYA id="014044">And warn people of the day when the chastisement shall come to them, then those who were unjust will say: O our Lord! respite us to a near term, (so) we shall respond to Thy call and follow the apostles. What! did you not swear before (that) there will be no passing away for you!</AYA>
		<AYA id="014045">And you dwell in the abodes of those who were unjust to themselves, and it is clear to you how We dealt with them and We have made (them) examples to you.</AYA>
		<AYA id="014046">And they have indeed planned their plan, but their plan is with Allah, though their plan was such that the mountains should pass away thereby.</AYA>
		<AYA id="014047">Therefore do not think Allah (to be one) failing in His promise to His apostles; surely Allah is Mighty, the Lord of Retribution.</AYA>
		<AYA id="014048">On the day when the earth shall be changed into a different earth, and the heavens (as well), and they shall come forth before Allah, the One, the Supreme.</AYA>
		<AYA id="014049">And you will see the guilty on that day linked together in chains.</AYA>
		<AYA id="014050">Their shirts made of pitch and the fire covering their faces</AYA>
		<AYA id="014051">That Allah may requite each soul (according to) what it has earned; surely Allah is swift in reckoning.</AYA>
		<AYA id="014052">This is a sufficient exposition for the people and that they may be warned thereby, and that they may know that He is One God and that those possessed of understanding may mind.</AYA>

		<AYA id="015001">Alif Lam Ra. These are the verses of the Book and (of) a Quran that makes (things) clear.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015002">Often will those who disbelieve wish that they had been Muslims.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015003">Leave them that they may eat and enjoy themselves and (that) hope may beguile them, for they will soon know.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015004">And never did We destroy a town but it had a term made known.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015005">No people can hasten on their doom nor can they postpone (it).</AYA>
		<AYA id="015006">And they say: O you to whom the Reminder has been revealed! you are most surely insane:</AYA>
		<AYA id="015007">Why do you not bring to us the angels if you are of the truthful ones?</AYA>
		<AYA id="015008">We do not send the angels but with truth, and then they would not be respited.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015009">Surely We have revealed the Reminder and We will most surely be its guardian.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015010">And certainly We sent (apostles) before you among the nations of yore.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015011">And there never came an apostle to them but they mocked him.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015012">Thus do We make it to enter into the hearts of the guilty;</AYA>
		<AYA id="015013">They do not believe in it, and indeed the example of the former people has already passed.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015014">And even if We open to them a gateway of heaven, so that they ascend into it all the while,</AYA>
		<AYA id="015015">They would certainly say: Only our eyes.have been covered over, rather we are an enchanted people.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015016">And certainly We have made strongholds in the heaven and We have made it fair seeming to the beholders.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015017">And We guard it against every accursed Shaitan,</AYA>
		<AYA id="015018">But he who steals a hearing, so there follows him a visible flame.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015019">And the earth-- We have spread it forth and made in it firm mountains and caused to grow in it of every suitable thing.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015020">And We have made in it means of subsistence for you and for him for whom you are not the suppliers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015021">And there is not a thing but with Us are the treasures of it, and We do not send it down but in a known measure.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015022">And We send the winds fertilizing, then send down water from the cloud so We give it to you to drink of, nor is it you who store it up.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015023">And most surely We bring to life and cause to die and We are the heirs.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015024">And certainly We know those of you who have gone before and We certainly know those who shall come later.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015025">And surely your Lord will gather them together; surely He is Wise, Knowing.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015026">And certainly We created man of clay that gives forth sound, of black mud fashioned in shape.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015027">And the jinn We created before, of intensely hot fire.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015028">And when your Lord said to the angels: Surely I am going to create a mortal of the essence of black mud fashioned in shape.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015029">So when I have made him complete and breathed into him of My spirit, fall down making obeisance to him.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015030">So the angels made obeisance, all of them together,</AYA>
		<AYA id="015031">But Iblis (did it not); he refused to be with those who made obeisance.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015032">He said: O Iblis! what excuse have you that you are not with those who make obeisance?</AYA>
		<AYA id="015033">He said: I am not such that I should make obeisance to a mortal whom Thou hast created of the essence of black mud fashioned in shape.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015034">He said: Then get out of it, for surely you are driven away:</AYA>
		<AYA id="015035">And surely on you is curse until the day of judgment.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015036">He said: My Lord! then respite me till the time when they are raised.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015037">He said: So surely you are of the respited ones</AYA>
		<AYA id="015038">Till the period of the time made known.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015039">He said: My Lord! because Thou hast made life evil to me, I will certainly make (evil) fair-seeming to them on earth, and I will certainly cause them all to deviate</AYA>
		<AYA id="015040">Except Thy servants from among them, the devoted ones.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015041">He said: This is a right way with Me:</AYA>
		<AYA id="015042">Surely. as regards My servants, you have no authority ,over them except those who follow you of the deviators.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015043">And surely Hell is the promised place of them all:</AYA>
		<AYA id="015044">It has seven gates; for every gate there shall be a separate party of them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015045">Surely those who guard (against evil) shall be in the midst of gardens and fountains:</AYA>
		<AYA id="015046">Enter them in peace, secure.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015047">And We will root out whatever of rancor is in their breasts-- (they shall be) as brethren, on raised couches, face to face.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015048">Toil shall not afflict them in it, nor shall they be ever ejected from it.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015049">Inform My servants that I am the Forgiving, the Merciful,</AYA>
		<AYA id="015050">And that My punishment-- that is the painful punishment.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015051">And inform them of the guests of Ibrahim:</AYA>
		<AYA id="015052">When they entered upon him, they said, Peace. He said: Surely we are afraid of you.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015053">They said: Be not afraid, surely we give you the good news of a boy, possessing knowledge.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015054">He said: Do you give me good news (of a son) when old age has come upon me?-- Of what then do you give me good news!</AYA>
		<AYA id="015055">They said: We give you good news with truth, therefore be not of the despairing.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015056">He said: And who despairs of the mercy of his Lord but the erring ones?</AYA>
		<AYA id="015057">He said: What is your business then, O messengers?</AYA>
		<AYA id="015058">They said: Surely we are sent towards a guilty people,</AYA>
		<AYA id="015059">Except Lut's followers: We will most surely deliver them all,</AYA>
		<AYA id="015060">Except his wife; We ordained that she shall surely be of those who remain behind.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015061">So when the messengers came to Lut's followers,</AYA>
		<AYA id="015062">He said: Surely you are an unknown people.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015063">They said: Nay, we have come to you with that about which they disputed.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015064">And we have come to you with the truth, and we are most surely truthful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015065">Therefore go forth with your followers in a part of the night and yourself follow their rear, and let not any one of you turn round, and go forth whither you are commanded.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015066">And We revealed to him this decree, that the roots of these shall be cut off in the morning.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015067">And the people of the town came rejoicing.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015068">He said: Surely these are my guests, therefore do not disgrace me,</AYA>
		<AYA id="015069">And guard against (the punishment of) Allah and do not put me to shame.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015070">They said: Have we not forbidden you from (other) people?</AYA>
		<AYA id="015071">He said: These are my daughters, if you will do (aught).</AYA>
		<AYA id="015072">By your life! they were blindly wandering on in their intoxication.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015073">So the rumbling overtook them (while) entering upon the time of sunrise;</AYA>
		<AYA id="015074">Thus did We turn it upside down, and rained down upon them stones of what had been decreed.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015075">Surely in this are signs for those who examine.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015076">And surely it is on a road that still abides.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015077">Most surely there is a sign in this for the believers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015078">And the dwellers of the thicket also were most surely unjust.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015079">So We inflicted retribution on them, and they are both, indeed, on an open road (still) pursued.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015080">And the dwellers of the Rock certainly rejected the messengers;</AYA>
		<AYA id="015081">And We gave them Our communications, but they turned aside from them;</AYA>
		<AYA id="015082">And they hewed houses in the mountains in security.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015083">So the rumbling overtook them in the morning;</AYA>
		<AYA id="015084">And what they earned did not avail them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015085">And We did not create the heavens and the earth and what is between them two but in truth; and the hour is most surely coming, so turn away with kindly forgiveness.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015086">Surely your Lord is the Creator of all things, the Knowing.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015087">And certainly We have given you seven of the oft-repeated (verses) and the grand Quran.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015088">Do not strain your eyes after what We have given certain classes of them to enjoy, and do not grieve for them, and make yourself gentle to the believers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015089">And say: Surely I am the plain warner.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015090">Like as We sent down on the dividers</AYA>
		<AYA id="015091">Those who made the Quran into shreds.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015092">So, by your Lord, We would most certainly question them all,</AYA>
		<AYA id="015093">As to what they did.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015094">Therefore declare openly what you are bidden and turn aside from the polytheists.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015095">Surely We will suffice you against the scoffers</AYA>
		<AYA id="015096">Those who set up another god with Allah; so they shall soon know.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015097">And surely We know that your breast straitens at what they say;</AYA>
		<AYA id="015098">Therefore celebrate the praise of your Lord, and be of those who make obeisance.</AYA>
		<AYA id="015099">And serve your Lord until there comes to you that which is certain.</AYA>

		<AYA id="016010">He it is Who sends down water from the cloud for you; it gives drink, and by it (grow) the trees upon which you pasture.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016011">He causes to grow for you thereby herbage, and the olives, and the palm trees, and the grapes, and of all the fruits; most surely there is a sign in this for a people who reflect.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016012">And He has made subservient for you the night and the day and the sun and the moon, and the stars are made subservient by His commandment; most surely there are signs in this for a people who ponder;</AYA>
		<AYA id="016013">And what He has created in the earth of varied hues most surely there is a sign in this for a people who are mindful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016014">And He it is Who has made the sea subservient that you may eat fresh flesh from it and bring forth from it ornaments which you wear, and you see the ships cleaving through it, and that you might seek of His bounty and that you may give thanks.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016015">And He has cast great mountains in the earth lest it might be convulsed with you, and rivers and roads that you may go aright,</AYA>

		<AYA id="016026">And if you take your turn, then retaliate with the like of that with which you were afflicted; but if you are patient, it will certainly be best for those who are patient.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016027">Then on the resurrection day He will bring them to disgrace and say: Where are the associates you gave Me, for whose sake you became hostile? Those who are given the knowledge will say: Surely the disgrace and the evil are this day upon the unbelievers:</AYA>
		<AYA id="016028">Those whom the angels cause to die while they are unjust to themselves. Then would they offer submission: We used not to do any evil. Aye! surely Allah knows what you did.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016029">Therefore enter the gates of hell, to abide therein; so certainly evil is the dwelling place of the proud.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016030">And it is said to those who guard (against evil): What is it that your Lord has revealed? They say, Good. For those who do good in this world is good, and certainly the abode of the hereafter is better; and certainly most excellent is the abode of those who guard (against evil);</AYA>
		<AYA id="016031">The gardens of perpetuity, they shall enter them, rivers flowing beneath them; they shall have in them what they please. Thus does Allah reward those who guard (against evil),</AYA>

		<AYA id="016033">They do not wait aught but that the angels should come to them or that the commandment of your Lord should come to pass. Thus did those before them; and Allah was not unjust to them, but they were unjust to themselves.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016034">So the evil (consequences) of what they did shall afflict them and that which they mocked shall encompass them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016035">And they who give associates (to Allah) say: If Allah had pleased, we would not have served anything besides Allah, (neither) we nor our fathers, nor would we have prohibited anything without (order from) Him. Thus did those before them; is then aught incumbent upon the apostles except a plain delivery (of the message)?</AYA>
		<AYA id="016036">And certainly We raised in every nation an apostle saying: Serve Allah and shun the Shaitan. So there were some of them whom Allah guided and there were others against whom error was due; therefore travel in the land, then see what was the.end of the rejecters.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016037">If you desire for their guidance, yet surely Allah does not guide him who leads astray, nor shall they have any helpers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016038">And they swear by Allah with the most energetic of their oaths: Allah will not raise up him who dies. Yea! it is a promise binding on Him, quite true, but most people do not know;</AYA>
		<AYA id="016039">So that He might make manifest to them that about which they differ, and that those who disbelieve might know that they were liars.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016040">Our word for a thing when We intend it, is only that We say to it, Be, and it is.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016041">And those who fly for Allah's sake after they are oppressed, We will most certainly give them a good abode in the world, and the reward of the hereafter is certainly much greater, did they but know;</AYA>
		<AYA id="016042">Those who are patient and on their Lord do they rely.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016043">And We did not send before you any but men to whom We sent revelation-- so ask the followers of the Reminder if you do not know--</AYA>
		<AYA id="016044">With clear arguments and scriptures; and We have revealed to you the Reminder that you may make clear to men what has been revealed to them, and that haply they may reflect.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016045">Do they then who plan evil (deeds) feel secure (of this) that Allah will not cause the earth to swallow them or that punishment may not overtake them from whence they do not perceive?</AYA>
		<AYA id="016046">Or that He may not seize them in the course of their journeys, then shall they not escape;</AYA>
		<AYA id="016047">Or that He may not seize them by causing them to suffer gradual loss, for your Lord is most surely Compassionate, Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016048">Do they not consider every thing that Allah has created? Its (very) shadows return from right and left, making obeisance to Allah while they are in utter abasement.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016049">And whatever creature that is in the heavens and that is in the earth makes obeisance to Allah (only), and the angels (too) and they do not show pride.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016050">They fear their Lord above them and do what they are commanded.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016051">And Allah has said: Take not two gods, He is only one God; so of Me alone should you be afraid.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016052">And whatever is in the heavens and the earth is His, and to Him should obedience be (rendered) constantly; will you then guard against other than (the punishment of) Allah?</AYA>
		<AYA id="016053">And whatever favor is (bestowed) on you it is from Allah; then when evil afflicts you, to Him do you cry for aid.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016054">Yet when He removes the evil from you, lo ! a party of you associate others with their Lord;</AYA>
		<AYA id="016055">So that they be ungrateful for what We have given them; then enjoy yourselves; for soon will you know</AYA>
		<AYA id="016056">And they set apart for what they do not know a portion of what We have given them. By Allah, you shall most certainly be questioned about that which you forged.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016057">And they ascribe daughters to Allah, glory be to Him; and for themselves (they would have) what they desire.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016058">And when a daughter is announced to one of them his face becomes black and he is full of wrath.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016059">He hides himself from the people because of the evil of that which is announced to him. Shall he keep it with disgrace or bury it (alive) in the dust? Now surely evil is what they judge.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016060">For those who do not believe in the hereafter is an evil attribute, and Allah's is the loftiest attribute; and He is the Mighty, the Wise.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016061">And if Allah had destroyed men for their iniquity, He would not leave on the earth a single creature, but He respites them till an appointed time; so when their doom will come they shall not be able to delay (it) an hour nor can they bring (it) on (before its time).</AYA>
		<AYA id="016062">And they ascribe to Allah what they (themselves) hate and their tongues relate the lie that they shall have the good; there is no avoiding it that for them is the fire and that they shall be sent before.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016063">By Allah, most certainly We sent (apostles) to nations before you, but the Shaitan made their deeds fair-seeming to them, so he is their guardian today, and they shall have a painful punishment.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016064">And We have not revealed to you the Book except that you may make clear to them that about which they differ, ind (as) a guidance and a mercy for a people who believe.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016065">And Allah has sent down water from the cloud and therewith given life to the earth after its death; most surely there is a sign in this for a people who would listen.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016066">And most surely there is a lesson for you in the cattle; We give you to drink of what is in their bellies-- from betwixt the feces and the blood-- pure milk, easy and agreeable to swallow for those who drink.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016067">And of the fruits of the palms and the grapes-- you obtain from them intoxication and goodly provision; most surely there is a sign in this for a people who ponder.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016068">And your Lord revealed to the bee saying: Make hives in the mountains and in the trees and in what they build:</AYA>
		<AYA id="016069">Then eat of all the fruits and walk in the ways of your Lord submissively. There comes forth from within it a beverage of many colours, in which there is healing for men; most surely there is a sign in this for a people who reflect.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016070">And Allah has created you, then He causes you to die, and of you is he who is brought back to the worst part of life, so that after having knowledge he does not know anything; surely Allah is Knowing, Powerful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016071">And Allah has made some of you excel others in the means of subsistence, so those who are made to excel do not give away their sustenance to those whom their right hands possess so that they should be equal therein; is it then the favor of Allah which they deny?</AYA>
		<AYA id="016072">And Allah has made wives for you from among yourselves, and has given you sons and grandchildren from your wives, and has given you of the good things; is it then in the falsehood that they believe while it is in the favor of Allah that they disbelieve?</AYA>
		<AYA id="016073">And they serve besides Allah that which does not control for them any sustenance at all from the heavens and the earth, nor have they any power.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016074">Therefore do not give likenesses to Allah; surely Allah knows and you do not know.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016075">Allah sets forth a parable: (consider) a slave, the property of another, (who) has no power over anything, and one whom We have granted from Ourselves a goodly sustenance so he spends from it secretly and openly; are the two alike? (All) praise is due to Allah! Nay, most of them do not know.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016076">And Allah sets forth a parable of two men; one of them is dumb, not able to do anything, and he is a burden to his master; wherever he sends him, he brings no good; can he be held equal with him who enjoins what is just, and he (himself) is on the right path?</AYA>
		<AYA id="016077">And Allah's is the unseen of the heavens and the earth; and the matter of the hour is but as the twinkling of an eye or it is higher still; surely Allah has power over all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016078">And Allah has brought you forth from the wombs of your mothers-- you did not know anything-- and He gave you hearing and sight and hearts that you may give thanks.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016079">Do they not see the birds, constrained in the middle of the sky? None withholds them but Allah; most surely there are signs in this for a people who believe.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016080">And Allah has given you a place to abide in your houses, and He has given you tents.of the skins of cattle which you find light to carry on the day of your march and on the day of your halting, and of their wool and their fur and their hair (He has given you) household stuff and a provision for a time.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016081">And Allah has made for you of what He has created shelters, and He has given you in the mountains places of retreat, and He has given you garments to preserve you from the heat and coats of mail to preserve you in your fighting; even thus does He complete His favor upon you, that haply you may submit.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016082">But if they turn back, then on you devolves only the clear deliverance (of the message).</AYA>
		<AYA id="016083">They recognize the favor of Allah, yet they deny it, and most of them are ungrateful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016084">And on the day when We will raise up a witness out of every nation, then shall no permission be given to those who E disbelieve, nor shall they be made to solicit favor.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016085">And when those who are unjust shall see the chastisement, it shall not be lightened for them, nor shall they be respited. .</AYA>
		<AYA id="016086">And when those who associate (others with Allah) shall see their associate-gods, they shall say: Our Lord, these are our associate-gods on whom we called besides Thee. But they will give them back the reply: Most surely you are liars.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016087">And they shall tender submission to Allah on that day; and what they used to forge shall depart from them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016088">(As for) those who disbelieve and turn away from Allah's way, We will add chastisement to their chastisement because they made mischief.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016089">And on the day when We will raise up in every people a witness against them from among themselves, and bring you as a witness against these-- and We have revealed the Book to you explaining clearly everything, and a guidance and mercy and good news for those who submit.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016090">Surely Allah enjoins the doing of justice and the doing of good (to others) and the giving to the kindred, and He forbids indecency and evil and rebellion; He admonishes you that you may be mindful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016091">And fulfill the covenant of Allah when you have made a covenant, and do not break the oaths after making them fast, and you have indeed made Allah a surety for you; surely Allah I . knows what you do.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016092">And be not like her who unravels her yarn, disintegrating it into pieces after she has spun it strongly. You make your oaths to be means of deceit between you because (one) nation is more numerous than (another) nation. Allah only tries you by this; and He will most certainly make clear to you on the resurrection day that about which you differed.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016093">And if Allah please He would certainly make you a single nation, but He causes to err whom He pleases and guides whom He pleases; and most certainly you will be questioned as to what you did.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016094">And do not make your oaths a means of deceit between you, lest a foot should slip after its stability and you should taste evil because you turned away from Allah's way and grievous punishment be your (lot).</AYA>
		<AYA id="016095">And do not take a small price in exchange for Allah's covenant; surely what is with Allah is better for you, did you but know.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016096">What is with you passes away and what is with Allah is enduring; and We will most certainly give to those who are patient their reward for the best of what they did.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016097">Whoever does good whether male or female and he is a believer, We will most certainly make him live a happy life, and We will most certainly give them their reward for the best of what they did.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016098">So when you recite the Quran, seek refuge with Allah from the accursed Shaitan,</AYA>
		<AYA id="016099">Surely he has no authority over those who believe and rely on their Lord.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016100">His authority is only over those who befriend him and those who associate others with Him.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016101">And when We change (one) communication for (another) communication, and Allah knows best what He reveals, they say: You are only a forger. Nay, most of them do not know.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016102">Say: The Holy spirit has revealed it from your Lord with the truth, that it may establish those who believe and as a guidance and good news for those who submit.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016103">And certainly We know that they say: Only a mortal teaches him. The tongue of him whom they reproach is barbarous, and this is clear Arabic tongue.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016104">(As for) those who do not believe in Allah's communications, surely Allah will not guide them, and they shall have a painful punishment.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016105">Only they forge the lie who do not believe in Allah's communications, and these are the liars.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016106">He who disbelieves in Allah after his having believed, not he who is compelled while his heart is at rest on account of faith, but he who opens (his) breast to disbelief-- on these is the wrath of Allah, and they shall have a grievous chastisement.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016107">This is because they love this world's life more than the hereafter, and because Allah does not guide the unbelieving people.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016108">These are they on whose hearts and their hearing and their eyes Allah has set a seal, and these are the heedless ones.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016109">No doubt that in the hereafter they will be the losers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016110">Yet surely your Lord, with respect to those who fly after they are persecuted, then they struggle hard and are patient, most surely your Lord after that is Forgiving, Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016111">(Remember) the day when every soul shall come, pleading for itself and every soul shall be paid in full what it has done, and they shall not be dealt with unjustly.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016112">And Allah sets forth a parable: (Consider) a town safe and secure to which its means of subsistence come in abundance from every quarter; but it became ungrateful to Allah's favors, therefore Allah made it to taste the utmost degree of hunger and fear because of what they wrought.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016113">And certainly there came to them an Apostle from among them, but they rejected him, so the punishment overtook them while they were unjust.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016114">Therefore eat of what Allah has given you, lawful and good (things), and give thanks for Allah's favor if Him do you serve.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016115">He has only forbidden you what dies of itself and blood and flesh of swine and that over which any other name than that of Allah has been invoked, but whoever is driven to necessity, not desiring nor exceeding the limit, then surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016116">And, for what your tongues describe, do not utter the lie, (saying) This is lawful and this is unlawful, in order to forge a lie against Allah; surely those who forge the lie against Allah shall not prosper.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016117">A little enjoyment and they shall have a painful punishment.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016118">And for those who were Jews We prohibited what We have related to you already, and We did them no injustice, but they were unjust to themselves.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016119">Yet surely your Lord, with respect to those who do an evil in ignorance, then turn after that and make amends, most surely your Lord after that is Forgiving, Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016120">Surely Ibrahim was an exemplar, obedient to Allah, upright, and he was not of the polytheists.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016121">Grateful for His favors; He chose him and guided him on the right path.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016122">And We gave him good in this world, and in the next he will most surely be among the good.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016123">Then We revealed to you: Follow the faith of Ibrahim, the upright one, and he was not of the polytheists.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016124">The Sabbath was ordained only for those who differed about it, and most surely your Lord will judge between them on the resurrection day concerning that about which they differed.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016125">Call to the way of your Lord with wisdom and goodly exhortation, and have disputations with them in the best manner; surely your Lord best knows those who go astray from His path, and He knows best those who follow the right way.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016126">And if you take your turn, then retaliate with the like of that with which you were afflicted; but if you are patient, it will certainly be best for those who are patient.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016127">And be patient and your patience is not but by (the assistance of) Allah, and grieve not for them, and do not distress yourself at what they plan.</AYA>
		<AYA id="016128">Surely Allah is with those who guard (against evil) and those who do good (to others).</AYA>

	<SOURA id="17" name="The Israelites">
		<AYA id="017001">Glory be to Him Who made His servant to go on a night from the Sacred Mosque to the remote mosque of which We have blessed the precincts, so that We may show to him some of Our signs; surely He is the Hearing, the Seeing.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017002">And We gave Musa the Book and made it a guidance to the children of Israel, saying: Do not take a protector besides Me;</AYA>
		<AYA id="017003">The offspring of those whom We bore with Nuh; surely he was a grateful servant.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017004">And We had made known to the children of Israel in the Book: Most certainly you will make mischief in the land twice, and most certainly you will behave insolently with great insolence.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017005">So when the promise for the first of the two came, We sent over you Our servants, of mighty prowess, so they went to and fro among the houses, and it was a promise to be accomplished.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017006">Then We gave you back the turn to prevail against them, and aided you with wealth and children and made you a numerous band.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017007">If you do good, you will do good for your own souls, and if you do evil, it shall be for them. So when the second promise came (We raised another people) that they may bring you to grief and that they may enter the mosque as they entered it the first time, and that they might destroy whatever they gained ascendancy over with utter destruction.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017008">It may be that your Lord will have mercy on you, and if you again return (to disobedience) We too will return (to punishment), and We have made hell a prison for the unbelievers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017009">Surely this Quran guides to that which is most upright and gives good news to the believers who do good that they shall have a great reward.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017010">And that (as for) those who do not believe in the hereafter, We have prepared for them a painful chastisement.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017011">And man prays for evil as he ought to pray for good, and man is ever hasty.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017012">And We have made the night and the day two signs, then We have made the sign of the night to pass away and We have made the sign of the day manifest, so that you may seek grace from your Lord, and that you might know the numbering of years and the reckoning; and We have explained everything with distinctness.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017013">And We have made every man's actions to cling to his neck, and We will bring forth to him on the resurrection day a book which he will find wide open:</AYA>
		<AYA id="017014">Read your book; your own self is sufficient as a reckoner against you this day.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017015">Whoever goes aright, for his own soul does he go aright; and whoever goes astray, to its detriment only does he go astray: nor can the bearer of a burden bear the burden of another, nor do We chastise until We raise an apostle.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017016">And when We wish to destroy a town, We send Our commandment to the people of it who lead easy lives, but they transgress therein; thus the word proves true against it, so We destroy it with utter destruction.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017017">And how many of the generations did We destroy after Nuh! and your Lord is sufficient as Knowing and Seeing with regard to His servants' faults.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017018">Whoever desires this present life, We hasten to him therein what We please for whomsoever We desire, then We assign to him the hell; he shall enter it despised, driven away.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017019">And whoever desires the hereafter and strives for it as he ought to strive and he is a believer; (as for) these, their striving shall surely be accepted.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017020">All do We aid-- these as well as those-- out of the bounty of your Lord, and the bounty of your Lord is not confined.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017021">See how We have made some of them to excel others, and certainly the hereafter is much superior in respect of excellence.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017022">Do not associate with Allah any other god, lest you sit down despised, neglected.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017023">And your Lord has commanded that you shall not serve (any) but Him, and goodness to your parents. If either or both of them reach old age with you, say not to them (so much as) "Ugh" nor chide them, and speak to them a generous word.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017024">And make yourself submissively gentle to them with compassion, and say: O my Lord! have compassion on them, as they brought me up (when I was) little.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017025">Your Lord knows best what is in your minds; if you are good, then He is surely Forgiving to those who turn (to Him) frequently.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017026">And give to the near of kin his due and (to) the needy and the wayfarer, and do not squander wastefully.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017027">Surely the squanderers are the fellows of the Shaitans and the Shaitan is ever ungrateful to his Lord.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017028">And if you turn away from them to seek mercy from your Lord, which you hope for, speak to them a gentle word.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017029">And do not make your hand to be shackled to your neck nor stretch it forth to the utmost (limit) of its stretching forth, lest you should (afterwards) sit down blamed, stripped off.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017030">Surely your Lord makes plentiful the means of subsistence for whom He pleases and He straitens (them); surely He is ever Aware of, Seeing, His servants.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017031">And do not kill your children for fear of poverty; We give them sustenance and yourselves (too); surely to kill them is a great wrong.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017032">And go not nigh to fornication; surely it is an indecency and an evil way.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017033">And do not kill any one whom Allah has forbidden, except for a just cause, and whoever is slain unjustly, We have indeed given to his heir authority, so let him not exceed the just limits in slaying; surely he is aided.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017034">And draw not near to the property of the orphan except in a goodly way till he attains his maturity and fulfill the promise; surely (every) promise shall be questioned about.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017035">And give full measure when you measure out, and weigh with a true balance; this is fair and better in the end.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017036">And follow not that of which you have not the knowledge; surely the hearing and the sight and the heart, all of these, shall be questioned about that.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017037">And do not go about in the land exultingly, for you cannot cut through the earth nor reach the mountains in height.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017038">All this-- the evil of it-- is hateful in the sight of your Lord.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017039">This is of what your Lord has revealed to you of wisdom, and do not associate any other god with Allah lest you should be thrown into hell, blamed, cast away.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017040">What! has then your Lord preferred to give you sons, and (for Himself) taken daughters from among the angels? Most surely you utter a grievous saying.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017041">And certainly We have repeated (warnings) in this Quran that they may be mindful, but it does not add save to their aversion.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017042">Say: If there were with Him gods as they say, then certainly they would have been able to seek a way to the Lord of power.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017043">Glory be to Him and exalted be He in high exaltation above what they say.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017044">The seven heavens declare His glory and the earth (too), and those who are in them; and there is not a single thing but glorifies Him with His praise, but you do not understand their glorification; surely He is Forbearing, Forgiving.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017045">And when you recite the Quran, We place between you and those who do not believe in the hereafter a hidden barrier;</AYA>
		<AYA id="017046">And We have placed coverings on their hearts and a heaviness in their ears lest they understand it, and when you mention your Lord alone in the Quran they turn their backs in aversion.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017047">We know best what they listen to when they listen to you, and when they take counsel secretly, when the unjust say: You follow only a man deprived of reason.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017048">See what they liken you to! So they have gone astray and cannot find the way.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017049">And they say: What! when we shall have become bones and decayed particles, shall we then certainly be raised up, being a new creation?</AYA>
		<AYA id="017050">Say: Become stones or iron,</AYA>
		<AYA id="017051">Or some other creature of those which are too hard (to receive life) in your minds! But they will say: Who will return us? Say: Who created you at first. Still they will shake their heads at you and say: When will it be? Say: Maybe it has drawn nigh.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017052">On the day when He will call you forth, then shall you obey Him, giving Him praise, and you will think that you tarried but a little (while).</AYA>
		<AYA id="017053">And say to My servants (that) they speak that which is best; surely the Shaitan sows dissensions among them; surely the Shaitan is an open enemy to man.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017054">Your Lord knows you best; He will have mercy on you if He pleases, or He will chastise you if He pleases; and We have not sent you as being in charge of them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017055">And your Lord best knows those who are in the heavens and the earth; and certainly We have made some of the prophets to excel others, and to Dawood We gave a scripture.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017056">Say: Call on those whom you assert besides Him, so they shall not control the removal of distress from you nor (its) transference.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017057">Those whom they call upon, themselves seek the means of access to their Lord-- whoever of them is nearest-- and they hope for His mercy and fear His chastisement; surely the chastisement of your Lord is a thing to be cautious of.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017058">And there is not a town but We will destroy it before the day of resurrection or chastise it with a severe chastisement; this is written in the Divine ordinance.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017059">And nothing could have hindered Us that We should send signs except that the ancients rejected them; and We gave to Samood the she-camel-- a manifest sign-- but on her account they did injustice, and We do not send signs but to make (men) fear.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017060">And when We said to you: Surely your Lord encompasses men; and We did not make the vision which We showed you but a trial for men and the cursed tree in the Quran as well; and We cause them to fear, but it only adds to their great inordinacy.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017061">And when We said to the angels: Make obeisance to Adam; they made obeisance, but Iblis (did it not). He said: Shall I make obeisance to him whom Thou hast created of dust?</AYA>
		<AYA id="017062">He said: Tell me, is this he whom Thou hast honored above me? If Thou shouldst respite me to the day of resurrection, I will most certainly cause his progeny to perish except a few.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017063">He said: Be gone! for whoever of them will follow you, then surely hell is your recompense, a full recompense:</AYA>
		<AYA id="017064">And beguile whomsoever of them you can with your voice, and collect against them your forces riding and on foot, and share with them in wealth and children, and hold out promises to them; and the Shaitan makes not promises to them but to deceive:</AYA>
		<AYA id="017065">Surely (as for) My servants, you have no authority over them; and your Lord is sufficient as a Protector.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017066">Your Lord is He Who speeds the ships for you in the sea that you may seek of His grace; surely He is ever Merciful to you.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017067">And when distress afflicts you in the sea, away go those whom you call on except He; but when He brings you safe to the land, you turn aside; and man is ever ungrateful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017068">What! Do you then feel secure that He will not cause a tract of land to engulf you or send on you a tornado? Then you shall not find a protector for yourselves.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017069">Or, do you feel secure that He will (not) take you back into it another time, then send on you a fierce gale and thus drown you on account of your ungratefulness? Then you shall not find any aider against Us in the matter.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017070">And surely We have honored the children of Adam, and We carry them in the land and the sea, and We have given them of the good things, and We have made them to excel by an appropriate excellence over most of those whom We have created.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017071">(Remember) the day when We will call every people with their Imam; then whoever is given his book in his right hand, these shall read their book; and they shall not be dealt with a whit unjustly.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017072">And whoever is blind in this, he shall (also) be blind in the hereafter; and more erring from the way.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017073">And surely they had purposed to turn you away from that which We have revealed to you, that you should forge against Us other than that, and then they would certainly have taken you for a friend.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017074">And had it not been that We had already established you, you would certainly have been near to incline to them a little;</AYA>
		<AYA id="017075">In that case We would certainly have made you to taste a double (punishment) in this life and a double (punishment) after death, then you would not have found any helper against Us.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017076">And.surely they purposed to unsettle you from the land that they might expel you from it, and in that case they will not tarry behind you but a little.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017077">(This is Our) course with regard to those of Our apostles whom We sent before you, and you shall not find a change in Our course.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017078">Keep up prayer from the declining of the sun till the darkness of the night and the morning recitation; surely the morning recitation is witnessed.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017079">And during a part of the night, pray Tahajjud beyond what is incumbent on you; maybe your Lord will raise you to a position of great glory.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017080">And say: My Lord! make me to enter a goodly entering, and cause me to go forth a goodly going forth, and grant me from near Thee power to assist (me).</AYA>
		<AYA id="017081">And say: The truth has come and the falsehood has vanished; surely falsehood is a vanishing (thing).</AYA>
		<AYA id="017082">And We reveal of the Quran that which is a healing and a mercy to the believers, and it adds only to the perdition of the unjust.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017083">And when We bestow favor on man, he turns aside and behaves proudly, and when evil afflicts him, he is despairing.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017084">Say: Every one acts according to his manner; but your Lord best knows who is best guided in the path.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017085">And they ask you about the soul. Say: The soul is one of the commands of my Lord, and you are not given aught of knowledge but a little.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017086">And if We please, We should certainly take away that which We have revealed to you, then you would not find for it any protector against Us.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017087">But on account of mercy from your Lord-- surely His grace to you is abundant.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017088">Say: If men and jinn should combine together to bring the like of this Quran, they could not bring the like of it, though some of them were aiders of others.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017089">And certainly We have explained for men in this Quran every kind of similitude, but most men do not consent to aught but denying.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017090">And they say: We will by no means believe in you until you cause a fountain to gush forth from the earth for us.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017091">Or you should have a garden of palms and grapes in the midst of which you should cause rivers to flow forth, gushing out.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017092">Or you should cause the heaven to come down upon us in pieces as you think, or bring Allah and the angels face to face (with us).</AYA>
		<AYA id="017093">Or you should have a house of gold, or you should ascend into heaven, and we will not believe in your ascending until you bring down to us a book which we may read. Say: Glory be to my Lord; am I aught but a mortal apostle?</AYA>
		<AYA id="017094">And nothing prevented people from believing when the guidance came to them except that they said: What! has Allah raised up a mortal to be an apostle?</AYA>
		<AYA id="017095">Say: Had there been in the earth angels walking about as settlers, We would certainly have sent down to them from the heaven an angel as an apostle.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017096">Say: Allah suffices as a witness between me and you; surely He is Aware of His servants, Seeing.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017097">And whomsoever Allah guides, he is the follower of the right way, and whomsoever He causes to err, you shall not find for him guardians besides Him; and We will gather them together on the day of resurrection on their faces, blind and dumb and deaf; their abode is hell; whenever it becomes allayed We will add to their burning.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017098">This is their retribution because they disbelieved in Our communications and said What! when we shall have become bones and decayed particles, shall we then indeed be raised up into a new creation?</AYA>
		<AYA id="017099">Do they not consider that Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth, is able to create their like, and He has appointed for them a doom about which there is no doubt? But the unjust do not consent to aught but denying.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017100">Say: If you control the treasures of the mercy of my Lord, then you would withhold (them) from fear of spending, and man is niggardly.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017101">And certainly We gave Musa nine clear signs; so ask the children of Israel. When he came to them, Firon said to him: Most surely I deem you, O Musa, to be a man deprived of reason.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017102">He said: Truly you know that none but the Lord of the heavens and the earth has sent down these as clear proof and most surely I believe you, O Firon, to be given over to perdition.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017103">So he desired to destroy them out of the earth, but We drowned him and those with him all together;</AYA>
		<AYA id="017104">And We said to the Israelites after him: Dwell in the land: and when the promise of the next life shall come to pass, we will bring you both together in judgment</AYA>
		<AYA id="017105">And with truth have We revealed it, and with truth did it come; and We have not sent you but as the giver of good news and as a warner.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017106">And it is a Quran which We have revealed in portions so that you may read it to the people by slow degrees, and We have revealed it, revealing in portions.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017107">Say: Believe in it or believe not; surely those who are given the knowledge before it fall down on their faces, making obeisance when it is recited to them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017108">And they say: Glory be to our Lord! most surely the promise of our Lord was to be fulfilled.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017109">And they fall down on their faces weeping, and it adds to their humility.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017110">Say: Call upon Allah or call upon, the Beneficent God; whichever you call upon, He has the best names; and do not utter your prayer with a very raised voice nor be silent with regard to it, and seek a way between these.</AYA>
		<AYA id="017111">And say: (All) praise is due to Allah, Who has not taken a son and Who has not a partner in the kingdom, and Who has not a helper to save Him from disgrace; and proclaim His greatness magnifying (Him).</AYA>
	</SOURA>


	<SOURA id="18" name="The Cave">
		<AYA id="018001">(All) praise is due to Allah, Who revealed the Book to His servant and did not make in it any crookedness.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018002">Rightly directing, that he might give warning of severe punishment from Him and give good news to the believers who do good that they shall have a goodly reward,</AYA>
		<AYA id="018003">Staying in it for ever;</AYA>
		<AYA id="018004">And warn those who say: Allah has taken a son.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018005">They have no knowledge of it, nor had their fathers; a grievous word it is that comes out of their mouths; they speak nothing but a lie.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018006">Then maybe you will kill yourself with grief, sorrowing after them, if they do not believe in this announcement.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018007">Surely We have made whatever is on the earth an embellishment for it, so that We may try them (as to) which of them is best in works.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018008">And most surely We will make what is on it bare ground without herbage.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018009">Or, do you think that the Fellows of the Cave and the Inscription were of Our wonderful signs?</AYA>
		<AYA id="018010">When the youths sought refuge in the cave, they said: Our Lord! grant us mercy from Thee, and provide for us a right course in our affair.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018011">So We prevented them from hearing in the cave for a number of years.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018012">Then We raised them up that We might know which of the two parties was best able to compute the time for which they remained.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018013">We relate to you their story with the truth; surely they were youths who believed in their Lord and We increased them in guidance.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018014">And We strengthened their hearts with patience, when they stood up and said: Our Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth; we will by no means call upon any god besides Him, for then indeed we should have said an extravagant thing.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018015">These our people have taken gods besides Him; why do they not produce any clear authority in their support? Who is then more unjust than he who forges a lie against Allah?</AYA>
		<AYA id="018016">And when you forsake them and what they worship save Allah, betake yourselves for refuge to the cave; your Lord will extend to you largely of His mercy and provide for you a profitable course in your affair.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018017">And you might see the sun when it rose, decline from their cave towards the right hand, and when it set, leave them behind on the left while they were in a wide space thereof. This is of the signs of Allah; whomsoever Allah guides, he is the rightly guided one, and whomsoever He causes to err, you shall not find for him any friend to lead (him) aright.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018018">And you might think them awake while they were asleep and We turned them about to the right and to the left, while their dog (lay) outstretching its paws at the entrance; if you looked at them you would certainly turn back from them in flight, and you would certainly be filled with awe because of them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018019">And thus did We rouse them that they might question each other. A speaker among them said: How long have you tarried? They said: We have tarried for a day or a part of a day. (Others) said: Your Lord knows best how long you have tarried. Now send one of you with this silver (coin) of yours to the city, then let him see which of them has purest food, so let him bring you provision from it, and let him behave with gentleness, and by no means make your case known to any one:</AYA>
		<AYA id="018020">For surely if they prevail against you they would stone you to death or force you back to their religion, and then you will never succeed.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018021">And thus did We make (men) to get knowledge of them that they might know that Allah's promise is true and that as for the hour there is no doubt about it. When they disputed among themselves about their affair and said: Erect an edifice over them-- their Lord best knows them. Those who prevailed in their affair said: We will certainly raise a masjid over them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018022">(Some) say: (They are) three, the fourth of them being their dog; and (others) say: Five, the sixth of them being their dog, making conjectures at what is unknown; and (others yet) say: Seven, and the eighth of them is their dog. Say: My Lord best knows their number, none knows them but a few; therefore contend not in the matter of them but with an outward contention, and do not question concerning them any of them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018023">And do not say of anything: Surely I will do it tomorrow,</AYA>
		<AYA id="018024">Unless Allah pleases; and remember your Lord when you forget and say: Maybe my Lord will guide me to a nearer course to the right than this.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018025">And they remained in their cave three hundred years and (some) add (another) nine.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018026">Say: Allah knows best how long they remained; to Him are (known) the unseen things of the heavens and the earth; how clear His sight and how clear His hearing! There is none to be a guardian for them besides Him, and He does not make any one His associate in His Judgment.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018027">And recite what has been revealed to you of the Book of your Lord, there is none who can alter His words; and you shall not find any refuge besides Him.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018028">And withhold yourself with those who call on their Lord morning and evening desiring His goodwill, and let not your eyes pass from them, desiring the beauties of this world's life; and do not follow him whose heart We have made unmindful to Our remembrance, and he follows his low desires and his case is one in which due bounds are exceeded.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018029">And say: The truth is from your Lord, so let him who please believe, and let him who please disbelieve; surely We have prepared for the iniquitous a fire, the curtains of which shall encompass them about; and if they cry for water, they shall be given water like molten brass which will scald their faces; evil the drink and ill the resting-place.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018030">Surely (as for) those who believe and do good, We do not waste the reward of him who does a good work.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018031">These it is for whom are gardens of perpetuity beneath which rivers flow, ornaments shall be given to them therein of bracelets of gold, and they shall wear green robes of fine silk and thick silk brocade interwoven with gold, reclining therein on raised couches; excellent the recompense and goodly the resting place.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018032">And set forth to them a parable of two men; for one of them We made two gardens of grape vines, and We surrounded them both with palms, and in the midst of them We made cornfields.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018033">Both these gardens yielded their fruits, and failed not aught thereof, and We caused a river to gush forth in their midst,</AYA>
		<AYA id="018034">And he possessed much wealth; so he said to his companion, while he disputed with him: I have greater wealth than you, and am mightier in followers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018035">And he entered his garden while he was unjust to himself. He said: I do not think that this will ever perish</AYA>
		<AYA id="018036">And I do not think the hour will come, and even if I am returned to my Lord I will most certainly find a returning place better than this.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018037">His companion said to him while disputing with him: Do you disbelieve in Him Who created you from dust, then from a small seed, then He made you a perfect man?</AYA>
		<AYA id="018038">But as for me, He, Allah, is my Lord, and I do not associate anyone with my Lord.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018039">And wherefore did you not say when you entered your garden: It is as Allah has pleased, there is no power save in Allah? If you consider me to be inferior to you in wealth and children,</AYA>
		<AYA id="018040">Then maybe my Lord will give me what is better than your garden, and send on it a thunderbolt from heaven so that it shall become even ground without plant,</AYA>
		<AYA id="018041">Or its waters should sink down into the ground so that you are unable to find it.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018042">And his wealth was destroyed; so he began to wring his hands for what he had spent on it, while it lay, having fallen down upon its roofs, and he said: Ah me! would that I had not associated anyone with my Lord.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018043">And he had no host to help him besides Allah nor could he defend himself</AYA>
		<AYA id="018044">Here is protection only Allah's, the True One; He is best in (the giving of) reward and best in requiting.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018045">And set forth to them parable of the life of this world: like water which We send down from the cloud so the herbage of the earth becomes tangled on account of it, then it becomes dry broken into pieces which the winds scatter; and Allah is the holder of power over all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018046">Wealth and children are an adornment of the life of this world; and the ever-abiding, the good works, are better with your Lord in reward and better in expectation.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018047">And the day on which We will cause the mountains to pass away and you will see the earth a levelled plain and We will gather them and leave not any one of them behind.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018048">And they shall be brought before your Lord, standing in ranks: Now certainly you have come to Us as We created you at first. Nay, you thought that We had not appointed to you a time of the fulfillment of the promise.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018049">And the Book shall be placed, then you will see the guilty fearing from what is in it, and they will say: Ah! woe to us! what a book is this! it does not omit a small one nor a great one, but numbers them (all); and what they had done they shall find present (there); and your Lord does not deal unjustly with anyone.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018050">And when We said to the angels: Make obeisance to Adam; they made obeisance but Iblis (did it not). He was of the jinn, so he transgressed the commandment of his Lord. What! would you then take him and his offspring for friends rather than Me, and they are your enemies? Evil is (this) change for the unjust.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018051">I did not make them witnesses of the creation of the heavens and the earth, nor of the creation of their own souls; nor could I take those who lead (others) astray for aiders.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018052">And on the day when He shall say: Call on those whom you considered to be My associates. So they shall call on them, but they shall not answer them, and We will cause a separation between them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018053">And the guilty shall see the fire, then they shall know that they are going to fall into it, and they shall not find a place to which to turn away from it.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018054">And certainly We have explained in this Quran every kind of example, and man is most of all given to contention.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018055">And nothing prevents men from believing when the guidance comes to them, and from asking forgiveness of their Lord, except that what happened to the ancients should overtake them, or that the chastisement should come face to face with them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018056">And We do not send apostles but as givers of good news and warning, and those who disbelieve make a false contention that they may render null thereby the truth, and they take My communications and that with which they are warned for a mockery.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018057">And who is more unjust than he who is reminded of the communications of his Lord, then he turns away from them and forgets what his two hands have sent before? Surely We have placed veils over their hearts lest they should understand it and a heaviness in their ears; and if you call them to the guidance, they will not ever follow the right course in that case.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018058">And your Lord is Forgiving, the Lord of Mercy; were He to punish them for what they earn, He would certainly have hastened the chastisement for them; but for them there is an appointed time from which they shall not find a refuge.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018059">And (as for) these towns, We destroyed them when they acted unjustly, and We have appointed a time for their destruction.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018060">And when Musa said to his servant: I will not cease until I reach the junction of the two rivers or I will go on for years.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018061">So when they had reached the junction of the two (rivers) they forgot their fish, and it took its way into the sea, going away.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018062">But when they had gone farther, he said to his servant: Bring to us our morning meal, certainly we have met with fatigue from this our journey.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018063">He said: Did you see when we took refuge on the rock then I forgot the fish, and nothing made me forget to speak of it but the Shaitan, and it took its way into the river; what a wonder!</AYA>
		<AYA id="018064">He said: This is what we sought for; so they returned retracing their footsteps.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018065">Then they found one from among Our servants whom We had granted mercy from Us and whom We had taught knowledge from Ourselves.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018066">Musa said to him: Shall I follow you on condition that you should teach me right knowledge of what you have been taught?</AYA>
		<AYA id="018067">He said: Surely you cannot have patience with me</AYA>
		<AYA id="018068">And how can you have patience in that of which you have not got a comprehensive knowledge?</AYA>
		<AYA id="018069">He said: If Allah pleases, you will find me patient and I shall not disobey you in any matter.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018070">He said: If you would follow me, then do not question me about any thing until I myself speak to you about it</AYA>
		<AYA id="018071">So they went (their way) until when they embarked in the boat he made a hole in it. (Musa) said: Have you made a hole in it to drown its inmates? Certainly you have done a grievous thing.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018072">He said: Did I not say that you will not be able to have patience with me?</AYA>
		<AYA id="018073">He said: Blame me not for what I forgot, and do not constrain me to a difficult thing in my affair.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018074">So they went on until, when they met a boy, he slew him. (Musa) said: Have you slain an innocent person otherwise than for manslaughter? Certainly you have done an evil thing.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018075">He said: Did I not say to you that you will not be able to have patience with me?</AYA>
		<AYA id="018076">He said: If I ask you about anything after this, keep me not in your company; indeed you shall have (then) found an excuse in my case.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018077">So they went on until when they came to the people of a town, they asked them for food, but they refused to entertain them as guests. Then they found in it a wall which was on the point of falling, so he put it into a right state. (Musa) said: If you had pleased, you might certainly have taken a recompense for it.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018078">He said: This shall be separation between me and you; now I will inform you of the significance of that with which you could not have patience.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018079">As for the boat, it belonged to (some) poor men who worked on the river and I wished that I should damage it, and there was behind them a king who seized every boat by force.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018080">And as for the boy, his parents were believers and we feared lest he should make disobedience and ingratitude to come upon them:</AYA>
		<AYA id="018081">So we desired that their Lord might give them in his place one better than him in purity and nearer to having compassion.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018082">And as for the wall, it belonged to two orphan boys in the city, and there was beneath it a treasure belonging to them, and their father was a righteous man; so your Lord desired that they should attain their maturity and take out their treasure, a mercy from your Lord, and I did not do it of my own accord. This is the significance of that with which you could not have patience.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018083">And they ask you about Zulqarnain. Say: I will recite to you an account of him</AYA>
		<AYA id="018084">Surely We established him in the land and granted him means of access to every thing</AYA>
		<AYA id="018085">So he followed a course.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018086">Until when he reached the place where the sun set, he found it going down into a black sea, and found by it a people. We said: O Zulqarnain! either give them a chastisement or do them a benefit.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018087">He said: As to him who is injust, we will chastise him, then shall he be returned to his Lord, and He will chastise him with an exemplary chastisement: And as for him who believes and does good, he shall have goodly reward, and We will speak to him an easy word of Our command.</AYA>
		<AYA id="018088">Then he followed (another) course.</AYA>

	<SOURA id="19" name="Marium">
		<AYA id="019001">Kaf Ha Ya Ain Suad.</AYA>
		<AYA id="019002">A mention of the mercy of your Lord to His servant Zakariya.</AYA>
		<AYA id="019003">When he called upon his Lord in a low voice,</AYA>
		<AYA id="019004">He said: My Lord! surely my bones are weakened and my head flares with hoariness, and, my Lord! I have never been unsuccessful in my prayer to Thee:</AYA>
		<AYA id="019005">And surely I fear my cousins after me, and my wife is barren, therefore grant me from Thyself an heir,</AYA>
		<AYA id="019006">Who should inherit me and inherit from the children of Yaqoub, and make him, my Lord, one in whom Thou art well pleased.</AYA>
		<AYA id="019007">O Zakariya! surely We give you good news of a boy whose name shall be Yahya: We have not made before anyone his equal.</AYA>
		<AYA id="019008">He said: O my Lord! when shall I have a son, and my wife is barren, and I myself have reached indeed the extreme degree of old age?</AYA>
		<AYA id="019009">He said: So shall it be, your Lord says: It is easy to Me, and indeed I created you before, when you were nothing.</AYA>
		<AYA id="019010">He said: My Lord! give me a sign. He said: Your sign is that you will not be able to speak to the people three nights while in sound health.</AYA>
		<AYA id="019011">So he went forth to his people from his place of worship, then he made known to them that they should glorify (Allah) morning and evening.</AYA>
		<AYA id="019012">O Yahya! take hold of the Book with strength, and We granted him wisdom while yet a child</AYA>
		<AYA id="019013">And tenderness from Us and purity, and he was one who guarded (against evil),</AYA>
		<AYA id="019014">And dutiful to his parents, and he was not insolent, disobedient.</AYA>
		<AYA id="019015">And peace on him on the day he was born, and on the day he dies, and on the day he is raised to life</AYA>
		<AYA id="019016">And mention Marium in the Book when she drew aside from her family to an eastern place;</AYA>
		<AYA id="019017">So she took a veil (to screen herself) from them; then We sent to her Our spirit, and there appeared to her a well-made man.</AYA>
		<AYA id="019018">She said: Surely I fly for refuge from you to the Beneficent God, if you are one guarding (against evil).</AYA>
		<AYA id="019019">He said: I am only a messenger of your Lord: That I will give you a pure boy.</AYA>
		<AYA id="019020">She said: When shall I have a boy and no mortal has yet touched me, nor have I been unchaste?</AYA>
		<AYA id="019021">He said: Even so; your Lord says: It is easy to Me: and that We may make him a sign to men and a mercy from Us, and it is a matter which has been decreed.</AYA>
		<AYA id="019022">So she conceived him; then withdrew herself with him to a remote place.</AYA>
		<AYA id="019023">And the throes (of childbirth) compelled her to betake herself to the trunk of a palm tree. She said: Oh, would that I had died before this, and had been a thing quite forgotten!</AYA>
		<AYA id="019024">Then (the child) called out to her from beneath her: Grieve not, surely your Lord has made a stream to flow beneath you;</AYA>
		<AYA id="019025">And shake towards you the trunk of the palmtree, it will drop on you fresh ripe dates:</AYA>
		<AYA id="019026">So eat and drink and refresh the eye. Then if you see any mortal, say: Surely I have vowed a fast to the Beneficent God, so I shall not speak to any man today.</AYA>
		<AYA id="019027">And she came to her people with him, carrying him (with her). They said: O Marium! surely you have done a strange thing.</AYA>
		<AYA id="019028">O sister of Haroun! your father was not a bad man, nor, was your mother an unchaste woman.</AYA>
		<AYA id="019029">But she pointed to him. They said: How should we speak to one who was a child in the cradle?</AYA>
		<AYA id="019030">He said: Surely I am a servant of Allah; He has given me the Book and made me a prophet;</AYA>
		<AYA id="019031">And He has made me blessed wherever I may be, and He has enjoined on me prayer and poor-rate so long as I live;</AYA>
		<AYA id="019032">And dutiful to my mother, and He has not made me insolent, unblessed;</AYA>
		<AYA id="019033">And peace on me on the day I was born, and on the day I die, and on the day I am raised to life.</AYA>
		<AYA id="019034">Such is Isa, son of Marium; (this is) the saying of truth about which they dispute.</AYA>
		<AYA id="019035">It beseems not Allah that He should take to Himself a ! son, glory to be Him; when He has decreed a matter He only says to it "Be," and it is.</AYA>
		<AYA id="019036">And surely Allah is my Lord and your Lord, therefore serve Him; this is the right path.</AYA>
		<AYA id="019037">But parties from among them disagreed with each other, so woe to those who disbelieve, because of presence on a great</AYA>
		<AYA id="019038">How clearly shall they hear and how clearly shall they see on the day when they come to Us; but the unjust this day are in manifest error.</AYA>
		<AYA id="019039">And warn them of the day of intense regret, when the matter shall have been decided; and they are (now) in negligence and they do not believe.</AYA>
		<AYA id="019040">Surely We inherit the earth and all those who are on it, and to Us they shall be returned.</AYA>
		<AYA id="019041">And mention Ibrahim in the Book; surely he was a truthful man, a prophet.</AYA>
		<AYA id="019042">When he said to his father; O my father! why do you worship what neither hears nor sees, nor does it avail you in the least:</AYA>
		<AYA id="019043">O my father! truly the knowledge has come to me which has not come to you, therefore follow me, I will guide you on a right path:</AYA>
		<AYA id="019044">O my father! serve not the Shaitan, surely the Shaitan is disobedient to the Beneficent God:</AYA>
		<AYA id="019045">O my father! surely I fear that a punishment from the Beneficent God should afflict you so that you should be a friend of the Shaitan.</AYA>
		<AYA id="019046">He said: Do you dislike my gods, O Ibrahim? If you do not desist I will certainly revile you, and leave me for a time.</AYA>
		<AYA id="019047">He said: Peace be on you, I will pray to my Lord to forgive you; surely He is ever Affectionate to me:</AYA>
		<AYA id="019048">And I will withdraw from you and what you call on besides Allah, and I will call upon my Lord; may be I shall not remain unblessed in calling upon my Lord.</AYA>
		<AYA id="019049">So when he withdrew from them and what they worshipped besides Allah, We gave to him Ishaq and Yaqoub, and each one of them We made a prophet.</AYA>
		<AYA id="019050">And We granted to them of Our mercy, and We left (behind them) a truthful mention of eminence for them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="019051">And mention Musa in the Book; surely he was one purified, and he was an apostle, a prophet.</AYA>
		<AYA id="019052">And We called to him from the blessed side of the mountain, and We made him draw nigh, holding communion (with Us).</AYA>
		<AYA id="019053">And We gave to him out of Our mercy his brother Haroun a prophet.</AYA>
		<AYA id="019054">And mention Ismail in the Book; surely he was truthful in (his) promise, and he was an apostle, a prophet.</AYA>
		<AYA id="019055">And he enjoined on his family prayer and almsgiving, and was one in whom his Lord was well pleased.</AYA>
		<AYA id="019056">And mention Idris in the Book; surely he was a truthful man, a prophet,</AYA>
		<AYA id="019057">And We raised him high in Heaven.</AYA>
		<AYA id="019058">These are they on whom Allah bestowed favors, from among the prophets of the seed of Adam, and of those whom We carried with Nuh, and of the seed of Ibrahim and Israel, and of those whom We guided and chose; when the communications of the Beneficent God were recited to them, they fell down making obeisance and weeping.</AYA>
		<AYA id="019059">But there came after them an evil generation, who neglected prayers and followed and sensual desires, so they win meet perdition,</AYA>
		<AYA id="019060">Except such as repent and believe and do good, these shall enter the garden, and they shall not be dealt with unjustly in any way:</AYA>
		<AYA id="019061">The gardens of perpetuity which the Beneficent God has promised to His servants while unseen; surely His promise shall come to pass.</AYA>
		<AYA id="019062">They shall not hear therein any vain discourse, but only: Peace, and they shall have their sustenance therein morning and evening.</AYA>
		<AYA id="019063">This is the garden which We cause those of Our servants to inherit who guard (against evil).</AYA>
		<AYA id="019064">And we do not descend but by the command of your Lord; to Him belongs whatever is before us and whatever is behind us and whatever is between these, and your Lord is not forgetful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="019065">The Lord of the heavens and the earth and what is between them, so serve Him and be patient in His service. Do you know any one equal to Him?</AYA>
		<AYA id="019066">And says man: What! when I am dead shall I truly be brought forth alive?</AYA>

		<AYA id="021004">He said: My Lord knows what is spoken in the heaven and the earth, and He is the Hearing, the Knowing.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021005">Nay! say they: Medleys of dreams; nay! he has forged it; nay! he is a poet; so let him bring to us a sign as the former (prophets) were sent (with).</AYA>

		<AYA id="021007">And We did not send before you any but men to whom We sent revelation, so ask the followers of the reminder if you do not</AYA>
		<AYA id="021008">And We did not make them bodies not eating the food, and they were not to abide (forever).</AYA>
		<AYA id="021009">Then We made Our promise good to them, so We delivered them and those whom We pleased, and We destroyed the ex</AYA>
		<AYA id="021010">Certainly We have revealed to you a Book in which is your good remembrance; what! do you not then understand?</AYA>
		<AYA id="021011">And how many a town which was iniquitous did We demolish, and We raised up after it another people!</AYA>
		<AYA id="021012">So when they felt Our punishment, lo! they began to fly</AYA>
		<AYA id="021013">Do not fly (now) and come back to what you were made to lead easy lives in and to your dwellings, haply you will be questioned.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021014">They said: O woe to us! surely we were unjust.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021015">And this ceased not to be their cry till We made them cut</AYA>
		<AYA id="021016">And We did not create the heaven and the earth and what is between them for sport.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021017">Had We wished to make a diversion, We would have made it from before Ourselves: by no means would We do (it).</AYA>
		<AYA id="021018">Nay! We cast the truth against the falsehood, so that it breaks its head, and lo! it vanishes; and woe to you for what you describe;</AYA>
		<AYA id="021019">And whoever is in the heavens and the earth is His; and those who are with Him are not proud to serve Him, nor do they grow weary.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021020">They glorify (Him) by night and day; they are never languid.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021021">Or have they taken gods from the earth who raise (the dead).</AYA>
		<AYA id="021022">If there had been in them any gods except Allah, they would both have certainly been in a state of disorder; therefore glory be to Allah, the Lord of the dominion, above what they attribute (to Him).</AYA>
		<AYA id="021023">He cannot be questioned concerning what He does and they shall be questioned.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021024">Or, have they taken gods besides Him? Say: Bring your proof; this is the reminder of those with me and the reminder of those before me. Nay! most of them do not know the truth, so they turn aside.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021025">And We did not send before you any apostle but We revealed to him that there is no god but Me, therefore serve Me.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021026">And they say: The Beneficent God has taken to Himself a ! son. Glory be to Him. Nay! they are honored servants</AYA>

		<AYA id="021035">Every soul must taste of death and We try you by evil and good by way of probation; and to Us you shall be brought back.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021036">And when those who disbelieve see you, they do not take you but for one to be scoffed at: Is this he who speaks of your gods? And they are deniers at the mention of the Beneficent God.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021037">Man is created of haste; now will I show to you My signs, therefore do not ask Me to hasten (them) on.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021038">And they say: When will this threat come to pass if you are truthful?</AYA>
		<AYA id="021039">Had those who disbelieve but known (of the time) when they shall not be able to ward off the fire from their faces nor from their backs, nor shall they be helped.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021040">Nay, it shall come on them all of a sudden and cause them to become confounded, so they shall not have the power to avert it, nor shall they be respited.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021041">And certainly apostles before you were scoffed at, then there befell those of them who scoffed that at which they had scoffed.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021042">Say: Who guards you by night and by day from the Beneficent God? Nay, they turn aside at the mention of their Lord.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021043">Or, have they gods who can defend them against Us? They shall not be able to assist themselves, nor shall they be defended from Us.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021044">Nay, We gave provision to these and their fathers until life was prolonged to them. Do they not then see that We are visiting the land, curtailing it of its sides? Shall they then prevail?</AYA>
		<AYA id="021045">Say: I warn you only by revelation; and the deaf do not hear the call whenever they are warned.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021046">And if a blast of the chastisement of your Lord were to touch them, they will certainly say: O woe to us! surely we were unjust.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021047">And We will set up a just balance on the day of resurrection, so no soul shall be dealt with unjustly in the least; and though there be the weight of a grain of mustard seed, (yet) will We bring it, and sufficient are We to take account.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021048">And certainly We gave to Musa and Haroun the Furqan and a light and a reminder for those who would guard (against evil).</AYA>
		<AYA id="021049">(For) those who fear their Lord in secret and they are fearful of the hour.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021050">And this is a blessed Reminder which We have revealed; will you then deny it?</AYA>
		<AYA id="021051">And certainly We gave to Ibrahim his rectitude before, and We knew him fully well.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021052">When he said to his father and his people: What are these images to whose worship you cleave?</AYA>
		<AYA id="021053">They said: We found our fathers worshipping them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021054">He said: Certainly you have been, (both) you and your fathers, in manifest error.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021055">They said: Have you brought to us the truth, or are you one of the triflers?</AYA>
		<AYA id="021056">He said: Nay! your Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth, Who brought them into existence, and I am of those who bear witness to this:</AYA>
		<AYA id="021057">And, by Allah! I will certainly do something against your idols after you go away, turning back.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021058">So he broke them into pieces, except the chief of them, that haply they may return to it.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021059">They said: Who has done this to our gods? Most surely he is one of the unjust.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021060">They said: We heard a youth called Ibrahim speak of them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021061">Said they: Then bring him before the eyes of the people, perhaps they may bear witness.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021062">They said: Have you done this to our gods, O Ibrahim?</AYA>
		<AYA id="021063">He said: Surely (some doer) has done it; the chief of them is this, therefore ask them, if they can speak.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021064">Then they turned to themselves and said: Surely you yourselves are the unjust;</AYA>
		<AYA id="021065">Then they were made to hang down their heads: Certainly you know that they do not speak.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021066">He said:.What! do you then serve besides Allah what brings you not any benefit at all, nor does it harm you?</AYA>
		<AYA id="021067">Fie on you and on what you serve besides Allah; what! do you not then understand?</AYA>
		<AYA id="021068">They said: Burn him and help your gods, if you are going to do (anything).</AYA>
		<AYA id="021069">We said: O fire! be a comfort and peace to Ibrahim;</AYA>
		<AYA id="021070">And they desired a war on him, but We made them the greatest losers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021071">And We delivered him as well as Lut (removing them) to the land which We had blessed for all people.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021072">And We gave him Ishaq and Yaqoub, a son's son, and We made (them) all good.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021073">And We made them Imams who guided (people) by Our command, and We revealed to them the doing of good and the keeping up of prayer and the giving of the alms, and Us (alone) did they serve;</AYA>
		<AYA id="021074">And (as for) Lut, We gave him wisdom and knowledge, and We delivered him from the town which wrought abominations; surely they were an evil people, transgressors;</AYA>
		<AYA id="021075">And We took him into Our mercy; surely he was of the good.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021076">And Nuh, when he cried aforetime, so We answered him, and delivered him and his followers from the great calamity.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021077">And We helped him against the people who rejected Our communications; surely they were an evil people, so We drowned them all.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021078">And Dawood and Sulaiman when they gave judgment concerning the field when the people's sheep pastured therein by night, and We were bearers of witness to their judgment.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021079">So We.made Sulaiman to understand it; and to each one We gave wisdom and knowledge; and We made the mountains, and the birds to celebrate Our praise with Dawood; and We were the doers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021080">And We taught him the making of coats of mail for you, that they might protect you in your wars; will you then be grateful?</AYA>
		<AYA id="021081">And (We made subservient) to Sulaiman the wind blowing violent, pursuing its course by his command to the land which We had blessed, and We are knower of ail things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021082">And of the rebellious people there were those who dived for him and did other work besides that, and We kept guard over them;</AYA>
		<AYA id="021083">And Ayub, when he cried to his Lord, (saying): Harm has afflicted me, and Thou art the most Merciful of the merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021084">Therefore We responded to him and took off what harm he had, and We gave him his family and the like of them with them: a mercy from Us and a reminder to the worshippers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021085">And Ismail and Idris and Zulkifl; all were of the patient ones;</AYA>
		<AYA id="021086">And We caused them to enter into Our mercy, surely they were of the good ones.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021087">And Yunus, when he went away in wrath, so he thought that We would not straiten him, so he called out among afflictions: There is no god but Thou, glory be to Thee; surely I am of those who make themselves to suffer loss.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021088">So We responded to him and delivered him from the grief and thus do We deliver the believers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021089">And Zakariya, when he cried to his Lord: O my Lord leave me not alone; and Thou art the best of inheritors.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021090">So We responded to him and gave him Yahya and made his wife fit for him; surely they used to hasten, one with another In deeds of goodness and to call upon Us, hoping and fearing and they were humble before Us.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021091">And she who guarded her chastity, so We breathed into her of Our inspiration and made her and her son a sign for the nations.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021092">Surely this Islam is your religion, one religion (only), and I am your Lord, therefore serve Me.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021093">And they broke their religion (into sects) between them: to Us shall all come back.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021094">Therefore whoever shall do of good deeds and he is a believer, there shall be no denying of his exertion, and surely We will write (It) down for him.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021095">And it is binding on a town which We destroy that they shall not return.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021096">Even when Gog and Magog are let loose and they shall break forth from every elevated place.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021097">And the true promise shall draw nigh, then lo! the eyes of those who disbelieved shall be fixedly open: O woe to us! surely we were m a state of heedlessness as to this; nay, we were unjust.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021098">Surely you and what you worship besides Allah are the firewood of hell; to it you shall come.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021099">Had these been gods, they would not have come to it and all shall abide therein.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021100">For them therein shall be groaning and therein they shall not hear.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021101">Surely (as for) those for whom the good has already gone forth from Us, they shall be kept far off from it;</AYA>
		<AYA id="021102">They will not hear its faintest sound, and they shall abide in that which their souls long for.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021103">The great fearful event shall not grieve them, and the angels shall meet them: This is your day which you were promised.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021104">On the day when We will roll up heaven like the rolling up of the scroll for writings, as We originated the first creation, (so) We shall reproduce it; a promise (binding on Us); surely We will bring it about.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021105">And certainly We wrote in the Book after the reminder that (as for) the land, My righteous servants shall inherit it.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021106">Most surely in this is a message to a people who serve</AYA>
		<AYA id="021107">And We have hot sent you but as a mercy to the worlds.</AYA>
		<AYA id="021108">Say: It is only revealed to me that your God is one God; will you then submit?</AYA>
		<AYA id="021109">But if they turn back, say: I have given you warning m fairness and I do not know whether what you are threatened with is near or far:</AYA>
		<AYA id="021110">Surely He knows what is spoken openly and He knows what you hide:</AYA>

		<AYA id="022006">This is because Allah is the Truth and because He gives life to the dead and because He has power over all things</AYA>
		<AYA id="022007">And because the hour is coming, there is no doubt about it; and because Allah shall raise up those who are in the graves.</AYA>
		<AYA id="022008">And among men there is he who disputes about Allah without knowledge and without guidance and without an illuminating book,</AYA>
		<AYA id="022009">Turning away haughtily that he may lead (others) astray from the way of Allah; for him is disgrace in this world, and on the day of resurrection We will make him taste the punishment of burning:</AYA>
		<AYA id="022010">This is due to what your two hands have sent before, and because Allah is not in the least unjust to the servants.</AYA>
		<AYA id="022011">And among men is he who serves Allah (standing) on the verge, so that if good befalls him he is satisfied therewith, but if a trial afflict him he turns back headlong; he loses this world as well as the hereafter; that is a manifest loss.</AYA>
		<AYA id="022012">He calls besides Allah upon that which does not harm him and that which does not profit him, that is the great straying.</AYA>
		<AYA id="022013">He calls upon him whose harm is nearer than his profit; evil certainly is the guardian and evil certainly is the associate.</AYA>
		<AYA id="022014">Surely Allah will cause those who believe and do good deeds to enter gardens beneath which rivers flow, surely Allah does what He pleases.</AYA>
		<AYA id="022015">Whoever thinks that Allah will not assist him in this life and the hereafter, let him stretch a rope to the ceiling, then let him cut (it) off, then let him see if his struggle will take away that at which he is enraged.</AYA>
		<AYA id="022016">And thus have We revealed it, being clear arguments, and because Allah guides whom He intends.</AYA>
		<AYA id="022017">Surely those who believe and those who are Jews and the Sabeans and the Christians and the Magians and those who associate (others with Allah)-- surely Allah will decide between them on the day of resurrection; surely Allah is a witness over all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="022018">Do you not see that Allah is He, Whom obeys whoever is in the heavens and whoever is in the earth, and the sun and the moon and the stars, and the mountains and the trees, and the animals and many of the people; and many there are against whom chastisement has become necessary; and whomsoever Allah abases, there is none who can make him honorable; surely Allah does what He pleases.</AYA>
		<AYA id="022019">These are two adversaries who dispute about their Lord; then (as to) those who disbelieve, for them are cut out garments of fire, boiling water shall be poured over their heads.</AYA>
		<AYA id="022020">With it shall be melted what is in their bellies and (their) skins as well.</AYA>
		<AYA id="022021">And for them are whips of iron.</AYA>
		<AYA id="022022">Whenever they will desire to go forth from it, from grief, they shall be turned back into it, and taste the chastisement of burning.</AYA>
		<AYA id="022023">Surely Allah will make those who believe and do good deeds enter gardens beneath which rivers flow; they shall be adorned therein with bracelets of gold and (with) pearls, and their garments therein shall be of silk.</AYA>
		<AYA id="022024">And they are guided to goodly words and they are guided into the path of the Praised One.</AYA>
		<AYA id="022025">Surely (as for) those who disbelieve, and hinder (men) from Allah's way and from the Sacred Mosque which We have made equally for all men, (for) the dweller therein and (for) the visitor, and whoever shall incline therein to wrong unjustly, We will make him taste of a painful chastisement.</AYA>
		<AYA id="022026">And when We assigned to Ibrahim the place of the House, saying: Do not associate with Me aught, and purify My House for those who make the circuit and stand to pray and bow and prostrate themselves.</AYA>
		<AYA id="022027">And proclaim among men the Pilgrimage: they will come to you on foot and on every lean camel, coming from every remote path,</AYA>
		<AYA id="022028">That they may witness advantages for them and mention the name of Allah during stated days over what He has given them of the cattle quadrupeds, then eat of them and feed the distressed one, the needy.</AYA>
		<AYA id="022029">Then let them accomplish their needful acts of shaving and cleansing, and let them fulfil their vows and let them go round the Ancient House.</AYA>
		<AYA id="022030">That (shall be so); and whoever respects the sacred ordinances of Allah, it is better for him with his Lord; and the cattle are made lawful for you, except that which is recited to you, therefore avoid the uncleanness of the idols and avoid false words,</AYA>
		<AYA id="022031">Being upright for Allah, not associating aught with Him and whoever associates (others) with Allah, it is as though he had fallen from on high, then the birds snatch him away or the wind carries him off to a far-distant place.</AYA>
		<AYA id="022032">That (shall be so); and whoever respects the signs of Allah, this surely is (the outcome) of the piety of hearts.</AYA>
		<AYA id="022033">You have advantages in them till a fixed time, then their place of sacrifice is the Ancient House.</AYA>
		<AYA id="022034">And to every nation We appointed acts of devotion that they may mention the name of Allah on what He has given them of the cattle quadrupeds; so your God is One God, therefore to Him should you submit, and give good news to the humble,</AYA>
		<AYA id="022035">(To) those whose hearts tremble when Allah is mentioned, and those who are patient under that which afflicts them, and those who keep up prayer, and spend (benevolently) out of what We have given them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="022036">And (as for) the camels, We have made them of the signs of the religion of Allah for you; for you therein is much good; therefore mention the name of Allah on them as they stand in a row, then when they fall down eat of them and feed the poor man who is contented and the beggar; thus have We made them subservient to you, that you may be grateful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="022037">There does not reach Allah their flesh nor their blood, but to Him is acceptable the guarding (against evil) on your part; thus has He made them subservient to you, that you may magnify Allah because He has guided you aright; and give good news to those who do good (to others).</AYA>
		<AYA id="022038">Surely Allah will defend those who believe; surely Allah does not love any one who is unfaithful, ungrateful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="022039">Permission (to fight) is given to those upon whom war is made because they are oppressed, and most surely Allah is well able to assist them;</AYA>
		<AYA id="022040">Those who have been expelled from their homes without a just cause except that they say: Our Lord is Allah. And had there not been Allah's repelling some people by others, certainly there would have been pulled down cloisters and churches and synagogues and mosques in which Allah's name is much remembered; and surely Allah will help him who helps His cause; most surely Allah is Strong, Mighty.</AYA>
		<AYA id="022041">Those who, should We establish them in the land, will keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate and enjoin good and forbid evil; and Allah's is the end of affairs</AYA>
		<AYA id="022042">And if they reject you, then already before you did the people of Nuh and Ad and Samood reject (prophets).</AYA>
		<AYA id="022043">And the people of Ibrahim and the people of Lut,</AYA>
		<AYA id="022044">As well as those of Madyan and Musa (too) was rejected, but I gave respite to the unbelievers, then did I overtake them, so how (severe) was My disapproval.</AYA>
		<AYA id="022045">So how many a town did We destroy while it was unjust, so it was fallen down upon its roofs, and (how many a) deserted well and palace raised high.</AYA>
		<AYA id="022046">Have they not travelled in the land so that they should have hearts with which to understand, or ears with which to hear? For surely it is not the eyes that are blind, but blind are the hearts which are in the breasts.</AYA>

	<SOURA id="23" name="The Believers">
		<AYA id="023001">Successful indeed are the believers,</AYA>
		<AYA id="023002">Who are humble in their prayers,</AYA>
		<AYA id="023003">And who keep aloof from what is vain,</AYA>
		<AYA id="023004">And who are givers of poor-rate,</AYA>
		<AYA id="023005">And who guard their private parts,</AYA>
		<AYA id="023006">Except before their mates or those whom their right hands possess, for they surely are not blameable,</AYA>
		<AYA id="023007">But whoever seeks to go beyond that, these are they that exceed the limits;</AYA>
		<AYA id="023008">And those who are keepers of their trusts and their covenant,</AYA>
		<AYA id="023009">And those who keep a guard on their prayers;</AYA>
		<AYA id="023010">These are they who are the heirs,</AYA>
		<AYA id="023011">Who shall inherit the Paradise; they shall abide therein.</AYA>
		<AYA id="023012">And certainly We created man of an extract of clay,</AYA>
		<AYA id="023013">Then We made him a small seed in a firm resting-place,</AYA>
		<AYA id="023014">Then We made the seed a clot, then We made the clot a lump of flesh, then We made (in) the lump of flesh bones, then We clothed the bones with flesh, then We caused it to grow into another creation, so blessed be Allah, the best of the creators.</AYA>
		<AYA id="023015">Then after that you will most surely die.</AYA>
		<AYA id="023016">Then surely on the day of resurrection you shall be raised.</AYA>
		<AYA id="023017">And certainly We made above you seven heavens; and never are We heedless of creation.</AYA>
		<AYA id="023018">And We send down water from the cloud according to a measure, then We cause it to settle in the earth, and most surely We are able to carry it away.</AYA>
		<AYA id="023019">Then We cause to grow thereby gardens of palm trees and grapes for you; you have in them many fruits and from them do you eat;</AYA>
		<AYA id="023020">And a tree that grows out of Mount Sinai which produces oil and a condiment for those who eat.</AYA>
		<AYA id="023021">And most surely there is a lesson for you in the cattle: We make you to drink of what is in their bellies, and you have in them many advantages and of them you eat,</AYA>
		<AYA id="023022">And on them and on the ships you are borne.</AYA>
		<AYA id="023023">And certainly We sent Nuh to his people, and he said: O my people! serve Allah, you have no god other than Him; will you not then guard (against evil)?</AYA>
		<AYA id="023024">And the chiefs of those who disbelieved from among his people said: He is nothing but a mortal like yourselves who desires that he may have superiority over you, and if Allah had pleased, He could certainly have sent down angels. We have not heard of this among our fathers of yore:</AYA>
		<AYA id="023025">He is only a madman, so bear with him for a time.</AYA>
		<AYA id="023026">He said: O my Lord! help me against their calling me a liar.</AYA>
		<AYA id="023027">So We revealed to him, saying: Make the ark before Our eyes and (according to) Our revelation; and when Our command is given and the valley overflows, take into it of every kind a pair, two, and your followers, except those among them against whom the word has gone forth, and do not speak to Me in respect of those who are unjust; surely they shall be drowned.</AYA>
		<AYA id="023028">And when you are firmly seated, you and those with you, in the ark, say: All praise is due to Allah who delivered us from the unjust people:</AYA>
		<AYA id="023029">And say: O my Lord! cause me to disembark a blessed alighting, and Thou art the best to cause to alight.</AYA>
		<AYA id="023030">Most surely there are signs in this, and most surely We are ever trying (men).</AYA>
		<AYA id="023031">Then We raised up after them another generation.</AYA>
		<AYA id="023032">So We sent among them an apostle from among them, saying: Serve Allah, you have no god other than Him; will you not then guard (against evil)?</AYA>
		<AYA id="023033">And the chiefs of his people who disbelieved and called the meeting of the hereafter a lie, and whom We had given plenty to enjoy in this world's life, said: This is nothing but a mortal like yourselves, eating of what you eat from and drinking of what you drink.</AYA>
		<AYA id="023034">And if you obey a mortal like yourselves, then most surely you will be losers:</AYA>
		<AYA id="023035">What! does he threaten you that when you are dead and become dust and bones that you shall then be brought forth?</AYA>
		<AYA id="023036">Far, far is that which you are threatened with.</AYA>
		<AYA id="023037">There is n.aught but our life in this world; we die and we live and we shall not be raised again.</AYA>
		<AYA id="023038">He is naught but a man who has forged a lie against Allah, and we are not going to believe in him.</AYA>
		<AYA id="023039">He said: O my Lord! help me against their calling me a liar.</AYA>
		<AYA id="023040">He said: In a little while they will most certainly be repenting.</AYA>
		<AYA id="023041">So the punishment overtook them in justice, and We made them as rubbish; so away with the unjust people.</AYA>
		<AYA id="023042">Then We raised after them other generations.</AYA>
		<AYA id="023043">No people can hasten on their doom nor can they postpone (it).</AYA>
		<AYA id="023044">Then We sent Our apostles one after another; whenever there came to a people their apostle, they called him a liar, so We made some of them follow others and We made them stories; so away with a people who do not believe!</AYA>
		<AYA id="023045">Then We sent Musa and his brother Haroun, with Our communications and a clear authority,</AYA>
		<AYA id="023046">To Firon and his chiefs, but they behaved haughtily and they were an insolent people.</AYA>
		<AYA id="023047">And they said: What! shall we believe in two mortals like ourselves while their people serve us?</AYA>
		<AYA id="023048">So they rejected them and became of those who were destroyed.</AYA>
		<AYA id="023049">And certainly We gave Musa the Book that they may follow a right direction</AYA>
		<AYA id="023050">And We made the son of Marium and his mother a sign, and We gave them a shelter on a lofty ground having meadows and springs.</AYA>
		<AYA id="023051">O apostles! eat of the good things and do good; surely I know what you do.</AYA>
		<AYA id="023052">And surely this your religion is one religion and I am your Lord, therefore be careful (of your duty) to Me.</AYA>
		<AYA id="023053">But they cut off their religion among themselves into sects, each part rejoicing in that which is with them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="023054">Therefore leave them in their overwhelming ignorance till</AYA>
		<AYA id="023055">Do they think that by what We aid them with of wealth and children,</AYA>
		<AYA id="023056">We are hastening to them of good things? Nay, they do not perceive.</AYA>
		<AYA id="023057">Surely they who from fear of their Lord are cautious,</AYA>
		<AYA id="023058">And those who believe in the communications of their Lord,</AYA>
		<AYA id="023059">And those who do not associate (aught) with their Lord,</AYA>
		<AYA id="023060">And those who give what they give.(in alms) while their hearts are full of fear that to their Lord they must return,</AYA>
		<AYA id="023061">These hasten to good things and they are foremost in (attaining) them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="023062">And We do not lay on any soul a burden except to the extent of its ability, and with Us is a book which speaks the truth, and they shall not be dealt with unjustly.</AYA>
		<AYA id="023063">Nay, their hearts are in overwhelming ignorance with respect to it and they have besides this other deeds which they do.</AYA>
		<AYA id="023064">Until when We overtake those who lead easy lives among them with punishment, lo! they cry for succor.</AYA>
		<AYA id="023065">Cry not for succor this day; surely you shall not be given help from Us.</AYA>
		<AYA id="023066">My communications were indeed recited to you, but you used to turn back on your heels,</AYA>
		<AYA id="023067">In arrogance; talking nonsense about the Quran, and left him like one telling fables by night.</AYA>
		<AYA id="023068">Is it then that they do not ponder over what is said, or is it that there has come to them that which did not come to their fathers of old?</AYA>
		<AYA id="023069">Or is it that they have not recognized their Apostle, so that they deny him?</AYA>
		<AYA id="023070">Or do they say: There is madness in him? Nay! he has brought them the truth, and most of them are averse from the truth.</AYA>
		<AYA id="023071">And should the truth follow their low desires, surely the heavens and the earth and all those who are therein would have perished. Nay! We have brought to them their reminder, but from their reminder they turn aside.</AYA>
		<AYA id="023072">Or is it that you ask them a recompense? But the recompense of your Lord is best, and He is the best of those who provide sustenance.</AYA>
		<AYA id="023073">And most surely you invite them to a right way.</AYA>
		<AYA id="023074">And most surely those who do not believe in the hereafter are deviating from the way.</AYA>
		<AYA id="023075">And if We show mercy to them and remove the distress they have, they would persist in their inordinacy, blindly wandering on.</AYA>
		<AYA id="023076">And already We overtook them with chastisement, but they were not submissive to their Lord, nor do they humble themselves.</AYA>
		<AYA id="023077">Until when We open upon them a door of severe chastisement, lo! they are in despair at it.</AYA>
		<AYA id="023078">And He it is Who made for you the ears and the eyes and the hearts; little is it that you give thanks.</AYA>
		<AYA id="023079">And He it is Who multiplied you in the earth, and to Him you shall be gathered</AYA>
		<AYA id="023080">And He it is Who gives life and causes death, and (in) His (control) is the alternation of the night and the day; do you not then understand?</AYA>
		<AYA id="023081">Nay, they say the like of what the ancients said:</AYA>
		<AYA id="023082">They say: What! When we are dead and become dust and bones, shall we then be raised?</AYA>
		<AYA id="023083">Certainly we are promised this, and (so were) our fathers aforetime; this is naught but stories of those of old.</AYA>
		<AYA id="023084">Say: Whose is the earth, and whoever is therein, if you know?</AYA>
		<AYA id="023085">They will say: Allah's. Say: Will you not then mind?</AYA>
		<AYA id="023086">Say: Who is the Lord of the seven heavens and the Lord of the mighty dominion?</AYA>
		<AYA id="023087">They will say: (This is) Allah's. Say: Will you not then guard (against evil)?</AYA>
		<AYA id="023088">Say: Who is it in Whose hand is the kingdom of all things and Who gives succor, but against Him Succor is not given, if you do but know?</AYA>
		<AYA id="023089">They will say: (This is) Allah's. Say: From whence are you then deceived?</AYA>
		<AYA id="023090">Nay! We have brought to them the truth, and most surely they are liars.</AYA>
		<AYA id="023091">Never did Allah take to Himself a son, and never was there with him any (other) god-- in that case would each god have certainly taken away what he created, and some of them would certainly have overpowered others; glory be to Allah above what they describe!</AYA>
		<AYA id="023092">The Knower of the unseen and the seen, so may He be exalted above what they associate (with Him).</AYA>
		<AYA id="023093">Say: O my Lord! if Thou shouldst make me see what they are threatened with:</AYA>
		<AYA id="023094">My Lord! then place me not with the unjust.</AYA>
		<AYA id="023095">And most surely We are well able to make you see what We threaten them with.</AYA>
		<AYA id="023096">Repel evil by what is best; We know best what they describe.</AYA>
		<AYA id="023097">And say: O my Lord! I seek refuge in Thee from the evil suggestions of the Shaitans;</AYA>
		<AYA id="023098">And I seek refuge in Thee! O my Lord! from their presence.</AYA>
		<AYA id="023099">Until when death overtakes one of them, he says: Send me back, my Lord, send me back;</AYA>
		<AYA id="023100">Haply I may do good in that which I have left. By no means! it is a (mere) word that he speaks; and before them is a barrier until the day they are raised.</AYA>
		<AYA id="023101">So when the trumpet is blown, there shall be no ties of relationship between them on that day, nor shall they ask of each other.</AYA>
		<AYA id="023102">Then as for him whose good deeds are preponderant, these are the successful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="023103">And as for him whose good deeds are light, these are they who shall have lost their souls, abiding in hell</AYA>
		<AYA id="023104">The fire shall scorch their faces, and they therein shall be in severe affliction.</AYA>
		<AYA id="023105">Were not My communications recited to you? But you used to reject them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="023106">They shall say: O our Lord! our adversity overcame us and we were an erring people:</AYA>
		<AYA id="023107">O our Lord! Take us out of it; then if we return (to evil) surely we shall be unjust.</AYA>
		<AYA id="023108">He shall say: Go away into it and speak nat to Me;</AYA>
		<AYA id="023109">Surely there was a party of My servants who said: O OUI . Lord! we believe, so do Thou forgive us and have mercy on us, and Thou art the best of the Merciful ones.</AYA>
		<AYA id="023110">But you took them for a mockery until they made you forget My remembrance and you used to laugh at them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="023111">Surely I have rewarded them this day because they were patient, that they are the achievers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="023112">He will say: How many years did you tarry in the earth?</AYA>
		<AYA id="023113">They will say: We tarried a day or part of a day, but ask those who keep account.</AYA>
		<AYA id="023114">He will say: You did tarry but a little-- had you but known (it):</AYA>
		<AYA id="023115">What! did you then think that We had created you in vain and that you shall not be returned to Us?</AYA>
		<AYA id="023116">So exalted be Allah, the True King; no god is there but He, the Lord of the honorable dominion.</AYA>
		<AYA id="023117">And whoever invokes with Allah another god-- he has no proof of this-- his reckoning is only with his Lord; surely the unbelievers shall not be successful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="023118">And say: O my Lord! forgive and have mercy, and Thou art the best of the Merciful ones.</AYA>

Every man of them shall have what he has earned of sin; and (as for) him who took upon himself the main part thereof, he shall have a grievous chastisement.</AYA>
		<AYA id="024012">Why did not the believing men and the believing women, when you heard it, think well of their own people, and say: This is an evident falsehood?</AYA>
		<AYA id="024013">Why did they not bring four witnesses of it? But as they have not brought witnesses they are liars before Allah.</AYA>

		<AYA id="024023">Surely those who accuse chaste believing women, unaware (of the evil), are cursed in this world and the hereafter, and they shall have a grievous chastisement.</AYA>
		<AYA id="024024">On the day when their tongues and their hands and their feet shall bear witness against them as to what they did.</AYA>
		<AYA id="024025">On that day Allah will pay back to them in full their just reward, and they shall know that Allah is the evident Truth.</AYA>
		<AYA id="024026">Bad women .are for bad men and bad men are for bad women. Good women are for good men and good men are for good women</AYA>
		<AYA id="024027">O you who believe! Do not enter houses other than your own houses until you have asked permission and saluted their inmates; this is better for you, that you may be mindful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="024028">But if you do not find any one therein, then do not enter them until permission is given to you; and if it is said to you: Go back, then go back; this is purer for you; and Allah is Cognizant of what you do.</AYA>
		<AYA id="024029">It is no sin in you that you enter uninhabited houses wherein you have your necessaries; and Allah knows what you do openly and what you hide.</AYA>
		<AYA id="024030">Say to the believing men that they cast down their looks and guard their private parts; that is purer for them; surely Allah is Aware of what they do.</AYA>
		<AYA id="024031">And say to the believing women that they cast down their looks and guard their private parts and do not display their ornaments except what appears thereof, and let them wear their head-coverings over their bosoms, and not display their ornaments except to their husbands or their fathers, or the fathers of their husbands, or their sons, or the sons of their husbands, or their brothers, or their brothers' sons, or their sisters' sons, or their women, or those whom their right hands possess, or the male servants not having need (of women), or the children who have not attained knowledge of what is hidden of women; and let them not strike their feet so that what they hide of their ornaments may be known; and turn to Allah all of you, O believers! so that you may be successful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="024032">And marry those among you who are single and those who are fit among your male slaves and your female slaves; if they are needy, Allah will make them free from want out of His grace; and Allah is Ample-giving, Knowing.</AYA>
		<AYA id="024033">And let those who do not find the means to marry keep chaste until Allah makes them free from want out of His grace. And (as for) those who ask for a writing from among those whom your right hands possess, give them the writing if you know any good in them, and give them of the wealth of Allah which He has given you; and do not compel your slave girls to prostitution, when they desire to keep chaste, in order to seek the frail good of this world's life; and whoever compels them, then surely after their compulsion Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="024034">And certainly We have sent to you clear communications and a description of those who have passed away before you, and an admonition to those who guard (against evil).</AYA>
		<AYA id="024035">Allah is the light of the heavens and the earth; a likeness of His light is as a niche in which is a lamp, the lamp is in a glass, (and) the glass is as it were a brightly shining star, lit from a blessed olive-tree, neither eastern nor western, the oil whereof almost gives light though fire touch it not-- light upon light-- Allah guides to His light whom He pleases, and Allah sets forth parables for men, and Allah is Cognizant of all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="024036">In houses which Allah has permitted to be exalted and that His name may be remembered in them; there glorify Him therein in the mornings and the evenings,</AYA>
		<AYA id="024037">Men whom neither merchandise nor selling diverts from the remembrance of Allah and the keeping up of prayer and the giving of poor-rate; they fear a day in which the hearts and eyes shall turn about;</AYA>
		<AYA id="024038">That Allah may give them the best reward of what they have done, and give them more out of His grace; and Allah gives sustenance to whom He pleases without measure.</AYA>
		<AYA id="024039">And (as for) those who disbelieve, their deeds are like the mirage in a desert, which the thirsty man deems to be water; until when he comes to it he finds it to be naught, and there he finds Allah, so He pays back to him his reckoning in full; and Allah is quick in reckoning;</AYA>
		<AYA id="024040">Or like utter darkness in the deep sea: there covers it a wave above which is another wave, above which is a cloud, (layers of) utter darkness one above another; when he holds out his hand, he is almost unable to see it; and to whomsoever Allah does not give light, he has no light.</AYA>
		<AYA id="024041">Do you not see that Allah is He Whom do glorify all those who are in the heavens and the earth, and the (very) birds with expanded wings? He knows the prayer of each one and its glorification, and Allah is Cognizant of what they do.</AYA>
		<AYA id="024042">And Allah's is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and to Allah is the eventual coming.</AYA>
		<AYA id="024043">Do you not see that Allah drives along the clouds, then gathers them together, then piles them up, so that you see the rain coming forth from their midst? And He sends down of the clouds that are (like) mountains wherein is hail, afflicting therewith whom He pleases and turning it away from whom He pleases; the flash of His lightning almost takes away the sight.</AYA>
		<AYA id="024044">Allah turns over the night and the day; most surely there is a lesson in this for those who have sight.</AYA>
		<AYA id="024045">And Allah has created from water every living creature: so of them is that which walks upon its belly, and of them is that which walks upon two feet, and of them is that which walks upon four; Allah creates what He pleases; surely Allah has power over all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="024046">Certainly We have revealed clear communications, and Allah guides whom He pleases to the right way.</AYA>
		<AYA id="024047">And they say: We believe in Allah and in the apostle and we obey; then a party of them turn back after this, and these are not believers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="024048">And when they are called to Allah and His Apostle that he may judge between them, lo! a party of them turn aside.</AYA>
		<AYA id="024049">And if the truth be on their side, they come to him quickly, obedient</AYA>
		<AYA id="024050">Is there in their hearts a disease, or are they in doubt, or do they fear that Allah and His Apostle will act wrongfully towards them? Nay! they themselves are the unjust.</AYA>
		<AYA id="024051">The response of the believers, when they are invited to Allah and His Apostle that he may judge between them, is only to say: We hear and we obey; and these it is that are the successful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="024052">And he who obeys Allah and His Apostle, and fears Allah, and is careful of (his duty to) Him, these it is that are the achievers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="024053">And they swear by Allah with the most energetic of their oaths that if you command them they would certainly go forth. Say: Swear not; reasonable obedience (is desired); surely Allah is aware of what you do.</AYA>
		<AYA id="024054">Say: Obey Allah and obey the Apostle; but if you turn back, then on him rests that which is imposed on him and on you rests that which is imposed on you; and if you obey him, you are on the right way; and nothing rests on the Apostle but clear delivering (of the message).</AYA>
		<AYA id="024055">Allah has promised to those of you who believe and do good that He will most certainly make them rulers in the earth as He made rulers those before them, and that He will most certainly establish for them their religion which He has chosen for them, and that He will most certainly, after their fear, give them security in exchange; they shall serve Me, not associating aught with Me; and whoever is ungrateful after this, these it is who are the. transgressors.</AYA>
		<AYA id="024056">And keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate and obey the Apostle, so that mercy may be shown to you.</AYA>
		<AYA id="024057">Think not that those who disbelieve shall escape in the earth, and their abode is the fire; and certainly evil is the resort!</AYA>
		<AYA id="024058">O you who believe! let those whom your right hands possess and those of you who have not attained to puberty ask permission of you three times; before the morning prayer, and when you put off your clothes at midday in summer, and after the prayer of the nightfall; these are three times of privacy for you; neither is it a sin for you nor for them besides these, some of you must go round about (waiting) upon others; thus does Allah make clear to you the communications, and Allah is Knowing, Wise.</AYA>
		<AYA id="024059">And when the children among you have attained to puberty, let them seek permission as those before them sought permission; thus does Allah make clear to you His communications, and Allah is knowing, Wise.</AYA>
		<AYA id="024060">And (as for) women advanced in years who do not hope for a marriage, it is no sin for them if they put off their clothes without displaying their ornaments; and if they restrain themselves it is better for them; and Allah is Hearing, Knowing.</AYA>
		<AYA id="024061">There is no blame on the blind man, nor is there blame on the lame, nor is there blame on the sick, nor on yourselves that you eat from your houses, or your fathers' houses or your mothers' houses, or your brothers' houses, or your sisters' houses, or your paternal uncles' houses, or your paternal aunts' houses, or your maternal uncles' houses, or your maternal aunts' houses, or what you possess the keys of, or your friends' (houses). It is no sin in you that you eat together or separately. So when you enter houses, greet your people with a salutation from Allah, blessed (and) goodly; thus does Allah make clear to you the communications that you may understand.</AYA>
		<AYA id="024062">Only those are believers who believe in Allah and His Apostle, and when they are with him on a momentous affair they go not away until they have asked his permission; surely they who ask your permission are they who believe in Allah and His Apostle; so when they ask your permission for some affair of theirs, give permission to whom you please of them and ask forgiveness for them from Allah; surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="024063">Do not hold the Apostle's calling (you) among you to be like your calling one to the other; Allah indeed knows those who steal away from among you, concealing themselves; therefore let those beware who go against his order lest a trial afflict them or there befall them a painful chastisement.</AYA>
		<AYA id="024064">Now surely Allah's is whatever is in the heavens and the earth; He knows indeed that to which you are conforming yourselves; and on the day on which they are returned to Him He will inform them of what they did; and Allah is Cognizant of all things.</AYA>

		<AYA id="025008">Or (why is not) a treasure sent down to him, or he is made to have a garden from which he should eat? And the unjust say: You do not follow any but a man deprived of reason.</AYA>

		<AYA id="025021">And those who do not hope for Our meeting, say: Why have not angels been sent down upon us, or (why) do we not see our Lord? Now certainly they are too proud of themselves and have revolted in great revolt.</AYA>

		<AYA id="025028">O woe is me! would that I had not taken such a one for a friend !</AYA>
		<AYA id="025029">Certainly he led me astray from the reminder after it had come to me; and the Shaitan fails to aid man.</AYA>
		<AYA id="025030">And the Apostle cried out: O my Lord! surely my people have treated this Quran as a forsaken thing.</AYA>

		<AYA id="025034">(As for) those who shall be gathered upon their faces to hell, they are in a worse plight and straying farther away from the path.</AYA>
		<AYA id="025035">And certainly We gave Musa the Book and We appointed with him his brother Haroun an aider.</AYA>
		<AYA id="025036">Then We said: Go you both to the people who rejected Our communications; so We destroyed them with utter destruction.</AYA>
		<AYA id="025037">And the people of Nuh, when they rejected the apostles, We drowned them, and made them a sign for men, and We have prepared a painful punishment for the unjust;</AYA>

		<AYA id="025039">And to every one We gave examples and every one did We destroy with utter destruction.</AYA>
		<AYA id="025040">And certainly they have (often) passed by the town on which was rained an evil rain; did they not then see it? Nay! they did not hope to be raised again.</AYA>
		<AYA id="025041">And when they see you, they do not take you for aught but a mockery: Is this he whom Allah has raised to be an apostle?</AYA>
		<AYA id="025042">He had well-nigh led us astray from our gods had we not adhered to them patiently! And they will know, when they see the punishment, who is straying farther off from the path.</AYA>
		<AYA id="025043">Have you seen him who takes his low desires for his god? Will you then be a protector over him?</AYA>
		<AYA id="025044">Or do you think that most of them do hear or understand? They are nothing but as cattle; nay, they are straying farther off from the path.</AYA>
		<AYA id="025045">Have you not considered (the work of) your Lord, how He extends the shade? And if He had pleased He would certainly have made it stationary; then We have made the sun an indication of it</AYA>
		<AYA id="025046">Then We take it to Ourselves, taking little by little.</AYA>
		<AYA id="025047">And He it is Who made the night a covering for you, and the sleep a rest, and He made the day to rise up again.</AYA>
		<AYA id="025048">And He it is Who sends the winds as good news before His mercy; and We send down pure water from the cloud,</AYA>

		<AYA id="025050">And certainly We have repeated this to them that they may be mindful, but the greater number of men do not consent to aught except denying.</AYA>
		<AYA id="025051">And if We had pleased We would certainly have raised a warner in every town.</AYA>
		<AYA id="025052">So do not follow the unbelievers, and strive against them a mighty striving with it.</AYA>
		<AYA id="025053">And He it is Who has made two seas to flow freely, the one sweet that subdues thirst by its sweetness, and the other salt that burns by its saltness; and between the two He has made a barrier and inviolable obstruction.</AYA>

		<AYA id="025063">And the servants of the Beneficent God are they who walk on the earth in humbleness, and when the ignorant address them, they say: Peace.</AYA>
		<AYA id="025064">And they who pass the night prostrating themselves before their Lord and standing.</AYA>
		<AYA id="025065">And they who say: O our Lord! turn away from us the punishment of hell, surely the punishment thereof is a lasting</AYA>
		<AYA id="025066">Surely it is an evil abode and (evil) place to stay.</AYA>
		<AYA id="025067">And they who when they spend, are neither extravagant nor parsimonious, and (keep) between these the just mean.</AYA>
		<AYA id="025068">And they who do not call upon another god with Allah and do not slay the soul, which Allah has forbidden except in the requirements of justice, and (who) do not commit fornication and he who does this shall find a requital of sin;</AYA>

		<AYA id="026005">And there does not come to them a new reminder from the Beneficent God but they turn aside from it.</AYA>

		<AYA id="026014">And they have a crime against me, therefore I fear that they may slay me.</AYA>
		<AYA id="026015">He said: By no means, so go you both with Our signs; surely We are with you, hearing;</AYA>
		<AYA id="026016">Then come to Firon and say: Surely we are the messengers of the Lord of the worlds:</AYA>
		<AYA id="026017">Then send with us the children of Israel.</AYA>
		<AYA id="026018">(Firon) said: Did we not bring you up as a child among us, and you tarried among us for (many) years of your life?</AYA>

		<AYA id="026049">Said he: You believe in him before I give you permission; most surely he is the chief of you who taught you the magic, so you shall know: certainly I will cut off your hands and your feet on opposite sides, and certainly I will crucify you all.</AYA>
		<AYA id="026050">They said: No harm; surely to our Lord we go back;</AYA>
		<AYA id="026051">Surely we hope that our Lord will forgive us our wrongs because we are the first of the believers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="026052">And We revealed to Musa, saying: Go away with My servants travelling by night, surely you will be pursued.</AYA>
		<AYA id="026053">So Firon sent heralds into the cities;</AYA>
		<AYA id="026054">Most surely these are a small company;</AYA>
		<AYA id="026055">And most surely they have enraged us;</AYA>
		<AYA id="026056">And most surely we are a vigilant multitude.</AYA>
		<AYA id="026057">So We turned them out of gardens and springs,</AYA>
		<AYA id="026058">And treasures and goodly dwellings,</AYA>
		<AYA id="026059">Even so. And We gave them as a heritage to the children of Israel.</AYA>
		<AYA id="026060">Then they pursued them at sunrise.</AYA>
		<AYA id="026061">So when the two hosts saw each other, the companions of Musa cried out: Most surely we are being overtaken.</AYA>
		<AYA id="026062">He said: By no means; surely my Lord is with me: He will show me a way out.</AYA>
		<AYA id="026063">Then We revealed to Musa: Strike the sea with your staff. So it had cloven asunder, and each part was like a huge mound.</AYA>
		<AYA id="026064">And We brought near, there, the others.</AYA>
		<AYA id="026065">And We saved Musa and those with him, all of them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="026066">Then We drowned the others.</AYA>
		<AYA id="026067">Most surely there is a sign in this, but most of them do not believe.</AYA>
		<AYA id="026068">And most surely your Lord is the Mighty, the Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="026069">And recite to them the story of Ibrahim.</AYA>
		<AYA id="026070">When he said to his father and his people: What do you worship?</AYA>
		<AYA id="026071">They said: We worship idols, so we shall be their votaries.</AYA>
		<AYA id="026072">He said: Do they hear you when you call?</AYA>
		<AYA id="026073">Or do they profit you or cause you harm?</AYA>
		<AYA id="026074">They said: Nay, we found our fathers doing so.</AYA>
		<AYA id="026075">He said: Have you then considered what you have been worshipping:</AYA>
		<AYA id="026076">You and your ancient sires.</AYA>
		<AYA id="026077">Surely they are enemies to me, but not (so) the Lord of the worlds;</AYA>
		<AYA id="026078">Who created me, then He has shown me the way:</AYA>
		<AYA id="026079">And He Who gives me to eat and gives me to drink:</AYA>
		<AYA id="026080">And when I am sick, then He restores me to health</AYA>
		<AYA id="026081">And He Who will cause me to die, then give me life;</AYA>
		<AYA id="026082">And Who, I hope, will forgive me my mistakes on the day of judgment.</AYA>
		<AYA id="026083">My Lord: Grant me wisdom, and join me with the good</AYA>
		<AYA id="026084">And ordain for me a goodly mention among posterity</AYA>
		<AYA id="026085">And make me of the heirs of the garden of bliss</AYA>
		<AYA id="026086">And forgive my father, for surely he is of those who have gone astray;</AYA>
		<AYA id="026087">And disgrace me not on the day when they are raised</AYA>
		<AYA id="026088">The day on which property will not avail, nor sons</AYA>
		<AYA id="026089">Except him who comes to Allah with a heart free (from evil).</AYA>
		<AYA id="026090">And the garden shall be brought near for those who guard (against evil),</AYA>
		<AYA id="026091">And the hell shall be made manifest to the erring ones,</AYA>
		<AYA id="026092">And it shall be said to them: Where are those that you used to worship;</AYA>
		<AYA id="026093">Besides Allah? Can they help you or yet help themselves?</AYA>
		<AYA id="026094">So they shall be thrown down into it, they and the erring ones,</AYA>
		<AYA id="026095">And the hosts of the Shaitan, all.</AYA>
		<AYA id="026096">They shall say while they contend therein:</AYA>
		<AYA id="026097">By Allah! we were certainly in manifest error,</AYA>
		<AYA id="026098">When we made you equal to the Lord of the worlds;</AYA>
		<AYA id="026099">And none but the guilty led us astray;</AYA>
		<AYA id="026100">So we have no intercessors,</AYA>
		<AYA id="026101">Nor a true friend;</AYA>
		<AYA id="026102">But if we could but once return, we would be of the believers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="026103">Most surely there is a sign in this, but most of them do not believe.</AYA>
		<AYA id="026104">And most surely your Lord is the Mighty, the Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="026105">The people of Nuh rejected the apostles.</AYA>
		<AYA id="026106">When their brother Nuh said to them: Will you not guard (against evil)?</AYA>
		<AYA id="026107">Surely I am a faithful apostle to you;</AYA>
		<AYA id="026108">Therefore guard against (the punishment of) Allah and obey me</AYA>
		<AYA id="026109">And I do not ask you any reward for it; my reward is only with the Lord of the worlds:</AYA>
		<AYA id="026110">So guard against (the punishment of) Allah and obey me.</AYA>
		<AYA id="026111">They said: Shall we believe in you while the meanest follow you?</AYA>
		<AYA id="026112">He said: And what knowledge have I of what they do?</AYA>
		<AYA id="026113">Their account is only with my Lord, if you could perceive</AYA>
		<AYA id="026114">And I am not going to drive away the believers;</AYA>
		<AYA id="026115">I am naught but a plain warner.</AYA>
		<AYA id="026116">They said: If you desist not, O Nuh, you shall most certainly be of those stoned to death.</AYA>
		<AYA id="026117">He said: My Lord! Surely my people give me the lie!</AYA>
		<AYA id="026118">Therefore judge Thou between me and them with a (just) judgment, and deliver me and those who are with me of the believers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="026119">So We delivered him and those with him in the laden ark.</AYA>
		<AYA id="026120">Then We drowned the rest afterwards</AYA>
		<AYA id="026121">Most surely there is a sign in this, but most of them do not believe.</AYA>
		<AYA id="026122">And most surely your Lord is the Mighty, the Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="026123">Ad gave the lie to the apostles.</AYA>
		<AYA id="026124">When their brother Hud said to them: Will you not guard (against evil)?</AYA>
		<AYA id="026125">Surely I am a faithful apostle to you;</AYA>
		<AYA id="026126">Therefore guard against (the punishment of) Allah and obey me:</AYA>
		<AYA id="026127">And I do not ask you any reward for it; surely my reward is only with the Lord of the worlds</AYA>
		<AYA id="026128">Do you build on every height a monument? Vain is it that you do:</AYA>
		<AYA id="026129">And you make strong fortresses that perhaps you may</AYA>
		<AYA id="026130">And when you lay hands (on men) you lay hands (like) tyrants;</AYA>
		<AYA id="026131">So guard against (the punishment of) Allah and obey me</AYA>
		<AYA id="026132">And be careful of (your duty to) Him Who has given you abundance of what you know.</AYA>
		<AYA id="026133">He has given you abundance of cattle and children</AYA>
		<AYA id="026134">And gardens and fountains;</AYA>
		<AYA id="026135">Surely I fear for you the chastisement of a grievous day</AYA>
		<AYA id="026136">They said: It is the same to us whether you admonish or are not one of the admonishers</AYA>
		<AYA id="026137">This is naught but a custom of the ancients;</AYA>
		<AYA id="026138">And we are not going to be punished.</AYA>
		<AYA id="026139">So they gave him the lie, then We destroyed them. Most surely there is a sign in this, but most of them do not believe.</AYA>
		<AYA id="026140">And most surely your Lord is the Mighty, the Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="026141">Samood gave the lie to the apostles</AYA>
		<AYA id="026142">When their brother Salih said to them: Will you not guard (against evil)?</AYA>
		<AYA id="026143">Surely I am a faithful apostle to you</AYA>
		<AYA id="026144">Therefore guard against (the punishment of) Allah and obey me:</AYA>
		<AYA id="026145">And I do not ask you any reward for it; my reward is only with the Lord of the worlds:</AYA>
		<AYA id="026146">Will you be left secure in what is here;</AYA>
		<AYA id="026147">In gardens and fountains,</AYA>
		<AYA id="026148">And cornfields and palm-trees having fine spadices?</AYA>
		<AYA id="026149">And you hew houses out of the mountains exultingly;</AYA>
		<AYA id="026150">Therefore guard against (the punishment of) Allah and obey me;</AYA>
		<AYA id="026151">And do not obey the bidding of the extravagant,</AYA>
		<AYA id="026152">Who make mischief in the land and do not act aright.</AYA>
		<AYA id="026153">They said: You are only of the deluded ones;</AYA>
		<AYA id="026154">You are naught but a mortal like ourselves; so bring a sign if you are one of the truthful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="026155">He said: This is a she-camel; she shall have her portion of water, and you have your portion of water on an appointed time;</AYA>
		<AYA id="026156">And do not touch her with evil, lest the punishment of a grievous day should overtake you.</AYA>
		<AYA id="026157">But they hamstrung her, then regretted;</AYA>
		<AYA id="026158">So the punishment overtook them. Most surely there is a sign in this, but most of them do not believe.</AYA>
		<AYA id="026159">And most surely your Lord is the Mighty, the Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="026160">The people of Lut gave the lie to the apostles.</AYA>

		<AYA id="026163">Therefore guard against (the punishment of) Allah and obey me:</AYA>
		<AYA id="026164">And I do not ask you any reward for it; my reward is only with the Lord of the worlds;</AYA>
		<AYA id="026165">What! do you come to the males from among the creatures</AYA>
		<AYA id="026166">And leave what your Lord has created for you of your wives? Nay, you are a people exceeding limits.</AYA>
		<AYA id="026167">They said: If you desist not, O Lut! you shall surely be of those who are expelled.</AYA>
		<AYA id="026168">He said: Surely I am of those who utterly abhor your</AYA>
		<AYA id="026169">My Lord ! deliver me and my followers from what they do.</AYA>
		<AYA id="026170">So We delivered him and his followers all,</AYA>
		<AYA id="026171">Except an old woman, among those who remained behind.</AYA>
		<AYA id="026172">Then We utterly destroyed the others.</AYA>
		<AYA id="026173">And We rained down upon them a rain, and evil was the rain on those warned.</AYA>
		<AYA id="026174">Most surely there is a sign in this, but most of them do not believe.</AYA>
		<AYA id="026175">And most surely your Lord is the Mighty, the Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="026176">The dwellers of the thicket gave the lie to the apostles.</AYA>
		<AYA id="026177">When Shu'aib said to them: Will you not guard (against evil)?</AYA>
		<AYA id="026178">Surely I am a faithful apostle to you;</AYA>

		<AYA id="026180">And I do not ask you any reward for it, my reward is only with the Lord of the worlds;</AYA>
		<AYA id="026181">Give a full measure and be not of those who diminish;</AYA>
		<AYA id="026182">And weigh (things) with a right balance,</AYA>
		<AYA id="026183">And do not wrong men of their things, and do not act corruptly in the earth, making mischief.</AYA>
		<AYA id="026184">And guard against (the punishment of) Him who created you and the former nations.</AYA>
		<AYA id="026185">They said: You are only of those deluded;</AYA>
		<AYA id="026186">And you are naught but a mortal like ourselves, and we know you to be certainly of the liars.</AYA>
		<AYA id="026187">Therefore cause a portion of the heaven to come down upon us, if you are one of the truthful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="026188">He said: My Lord knows best what you do.</AYA>
		<AYA id="026189">But they called him a liar, so the punishment of the day of covering overtook them; surely it was the punishment of a grievous day.</AYA>

	<SOURA id="27" name="The Ant">
		<AYA id="027001">Ta Sin! These are the verses of the Quran and the Book that makes (things) clear</AYA>
		<AYA id="027002">A guidance and good news for the believers,</AYA>
		<AYA id="027003">Who keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate, and of the hereafter, they are sure.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027004">As to those who do not believe in the hereafter, We have surely made their deeds fair-seeming to them, but they blindly wander on.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027005">These are they who shall have an evil punishment, and in the hereafter they shall be the greatest losers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027006">And most surely you are made to receive the Quran from the Wise, the Knowing God.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027007">When Musa said to his family: Surely I see fire; I will bring to you from it some news, or I will bring to you therefrom a burning firebrand so that you may warm yourselves.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027008">So when he came to it a voice was uttered saying: Blessed is Whoever is in the fire and whatever is about it; and glory be to Allah, the Lord of the worlds;</AYA>
		<AYA id="027009">O Musa! surely I am Allah, the Mighty, the Wise;</AYA>
		<AYA id="027010">And cast down your staff. So when he saw it in motion as if it were a serpent, he turned back retreating and did not return: O Musa! fear not; surely the apostles shall not fear in My presence;</AYA>
		<AYA id="027011">Neither he who has been unjust, then he does good instead after evil, for surely I am the Forgiving, the Merciful:</AYA>
		<AYA id="027012">And enter your hand into the opening of your bosom, it shall come forth white without evil; among nine signs to Firon and his people, surely they are a transgressing people.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027013">So when Our clear signs came to them, they said: This is clear enchantment.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027014">And they denied them unjustly and proudly while their soul had been convinced of them; consider, then how was the end of the mischief-makers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027015">And certainly We gave knowledge to Dawood and Sulaiman, and they both said: Praise be to Allah, Who has made us to excel many of His believing servants.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027016">And Sulaiman was Dawood's heir, and he said: O men! we have been taught the language of birds, and we have been given all things; most surely this is manifest grace.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027017">And his hosts of the jinn and the men and the birds were gathered to him, and they were formed into groups.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027018">Until when they came to the valley of the Naml, a Namlite said: O Naml! enter your houses, (that) Sulaiman and his hosts may not crush you while they do not know</AYA>
		<AYA id="027019">So he smiled, wondering at her word, and said: My Lord! grant me that I should be grateful for Thy favor which Thou hast bestowed on me and on my parents, and that I should do good such as Thou art pleased with, and make me enter, by Thy mercy, into Thy servants, the good ones.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027020">And he reviewed the birds, then said: How is it I see not the hoopoe or is it that he is of the absentees?</AYA>
		<AYA id="027021">1 will most certainly punish him with a severe punishment, or kill him, or he shall bring to me a clear plea.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027022">And he tarried not long, then said: I comprehend that which you do not comprehend and I have brought to you a sure information from Sheba.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027023">Surely I found a woman ruling over them, and she has been given abundance and she has a mighty throne:</AYA>
		<AYA id="027024">1 found her and her people adoring the sun instead of Allah, and the Shaitan has made their deeds fair-seeming to them and thus turned them from the way, so they do not go aright</AYA>
		<AYA id="027025">That they do not make obeisance to Allah, Who brings forth what is hidden in the heavens and the earth and knows what you hide and what you make manifest:</AYA>
		<AYA id="027026">Allah, there is no god but He: He is the Lord of mighty power.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027027">He said: We will see whether you have told the truth or whether you are of the liars:</AYA>
		<AYA id="027028">Take this my letter and hand it over to them, then turn away from them and see what (answer) they return.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027029">She said: O chief! surely an honorable letter has been delivered to me</AYA>
		<AYA id="027030">Surely it is from Sulaiman, and surely it is in the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful;</AYA>
		<AYA id="027031">Saying: exalt not yourselves against me and come to me in submission.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027032">She said: O chiefs! give me advice respecting my affair: I never decide an affair until you are in my presence.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027033">They said: We are possessors of strength and possessors of mighty prowess, and the command is yours, therefore see what you will command.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027034">She said: Surely the kings, when they enter a town, ruin it and make the noblest of its people to be low, and thus they (always) do;</AYA>
		<AYA id="027035">And surely I am going to send a present to them, and shall wait to see what (answer) do the messengers bring back.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027036">So when he came to Sulaiman, he said: What! will you help me with wealth? But what Allah has given me is better than what He has given you. Nay, you are exultant because of your present;</AYA>
		<AYA id="027037">Go back to them, so we will most certainly come to them with hosts which they shall have no power to oppose, and we will most certainly expel them therefrom in abasement, and they shall be in a state of ignominy.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027038">He said: O chiefs! which of you can bring to me her throne before they come to me in submission?</AYA>
		<AYA id="027039">One audacious among the jinn said: I will bring it to you before you rise up from your place; and most surely I am strong (and) trusty for it.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027040">One who had the knowledge of the Book said: I will bring it to you in the twinkling of an eye. Then when he saw it settled beside him, he said: This is of the grace of my Lord that He may try me whether I am grateful or ungrateful; and whoever is grateful, he is grateful only for his own soul, and whoever is ungrateful, then surely my Lord is Self-sufficient, Honored.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027041">He said: Alter her throne for her, we will see whether she follows the right way or is of those who do not go aright.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027042">So when she came, it was said: Is your throne like this? She said: It is as it were the same, and we were given the knowledge before it, and we were submissive.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027043">And what she worshipped besides Allah prevented her, surely she was of an unbelieving people.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027044">It was said to her: Enter the palace; but when she saw it she deemed it to be a great expanse of water, and bared her legs. He said: Surely it is a palace made smooth with glass. She said: My Lord! surely I have been unjust to myself, and I submit with Sulaiman to Allah, the Lord of the worlds.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027045">And certainly We sent to Samood their brother Salih, saying: Serve Allah; and lo! they became two sects quarrelling with each other.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027046">He said: O my people! why do you seek to hasten on the evil before the good? Why do you not ask forgiveness of Allah so that you may be dealt with mercifully?</AYA>
		<AYA id="027047">They said: We have met with ill luck on account of you and on account of those with you. He said: The cause of your evil fortune is with Allah; nay, you are a people who are tried.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027048">And there were in the city nine persons who made mischief in the land and did not act aright.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027049">They said: Swear to each other by Allah that we will certainly make a sudden attack on him and his family by night, then we will say to his heir: We did not witness the destruction of his family, and we are most surely truthful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027050">And they planned a plan, and We planned a plan while they perceived not.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027051">See, then, how was the end of their plan that We destroyed them and their people, all (of them).</AYA>
		<AYA id="027052">So those are their houses fallen down because they were unjust, most surely there is a sign in this for a people who know.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027053">And We delivered those who believed and who guarded (against evil).</AYA>
		<AYA id="027054">And (We sent) Lut, when he said to his people: What! do you commit indecency while you see?</AYA>
		<AYA id="027055">What! do you indeed approach men lustfully rather than women? Nay, you are a people who act ignorantly.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027056">But the answer of his people was no other except that they ~s said: Turn out Lut's followers from your town; surely they are a people who would keep pure!</AYA>
		<AYA id="027057">But We delivered him and his followers except his wife; We ordained her to be of those who remained behind.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027058">And We rained on them a rain, and evil was the rain of those who had been warned.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027059">Say: Praise be to Allah and peace on His servants whom He has chosen: is Allah better, or what they associate (with Him)?</AYA>
		<AYA id="027060">Nay, He Who created the heavens and the earth, and sent down for you water from the cloud; then We cause to grow thereby beautiful gardens; it is not possible for you that you should make the trees thereof to grow. Is there a god with Allah? Nay! they are people who deviate.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027061">Or, Who made the earth a restingplace, and made in it rivers, and raised on it mountains and placed between the two seas a barrier. Is there a god with Allah? Nay! most of them do not know!</AYA>
		<AYA id="027062">Or, Who answers the distressed one when he calls upon Him and removes the evil, and He will make you successors in the earth. Is there a god with Allah? Little is it that you mind!</AYA>
		<AYA id="027063">Or, Who guides you in utter darkness of the land and the sea, and Who sends the winds as good news before His mercy. Is there a god with Allah? Exalted by Allah above what they associate (with Him).</AYA>
		<AYA id="027064">Or, Who originates the creation, then reproduces it and Who gives you sustenance from the heaven and the earth. Is there a god With Allah? Say: Bring your proof if you are truthful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027065">Say: No one in the heavens and the earth knows the unseen but Allah; and they do not know when they shall be raised.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027066">Nay, their knowledge respecting the hereafter is slight and hasty; nay, they are in doubt about it; nay, they are quite blind to</AYA>
		<AYA id="027067">And those who disbelieve say: What! when we have become dust and our fathers (too), shall we certainly be brought forth?</AYA>
		<AYA id="027068">We have certainly been promised this, we and our fathers before; these are naught but stories of the ancients</AYA>
		<AYA id="027069">Say: Travel in the earth, then see how was the end of the guilty.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027070">And grieve not for them and be not distressed because of what they plan.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027071">And they say: When will this threat come to pass, if you are truthful?</AYA>
		<AYA id="027072">Say: Maybe there may have drawn near to you somewhat of that which you seek to hasten on.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027073">And surely your Lord is the Lord of grace to men, but most of them are not grateful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027074">And most surely your Lord knows what their breasts conceal and what they manifest.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027075">And there is nothing concealed in the heaven and the earth but it is in a clear book.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027076">Surely this Quran declares to the children of Israel most of what they differ in.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027077">And most surely it is a guidance and a mercy for the believers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027078">Surely your Lord will judge between them by his judgment, and He is the Mighty, the knowing.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027079">Therefore rely on Allah; surely you are on the clear truth.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027080">Surely you do not make the dead to hear, and you do not make the deaf to hear the call when they go back retreating.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027081">Nor can you be a guide to the blind out of their error; you cannot make to bear (any one) except those who believe in Our communications, so they submit.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027082">And when the word shall come to pass against them, We shall bring forth for them a creature from the earth that shall i wound them, because people did not believe in Our communications.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027083">And on the day when We will gather from every nation a party from among those who rejected Our communications, then they shall be formed into groups.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027084">Until when they come, He will say: Did you reject My communications while you had no comprehensive knowledge of them? Or what was it that you did?</AYA>
		<AYA id="027085">And the word shall come to pass against them because they were unjust, so they shall not speak.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027086">Do they not consider that We have made the night that. they may rest therein, and the day to give light? Most surely there are signs in this for a people who believe.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027087">And on the day when the trumpet shall be blown, then those who are in the heavens and those who are in the earth shall be terrified except such as Allah please, and all shall come to him abased.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027088">And you see the mountains, you think them to be solid, and they shall pass away as the passing away of the cloud-- the handiwork of Allah Who has made every thing thoroughly; surely He is Aware of what you do.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027089">Whoever brings good, he shall have better than it; and they shall be secure from terror on the day.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027090">And whoever brings evil, these shall be thrown down on their faces into the fire; shall you be rewarded (for) aught except what you did?</AYA>
		<AYA id="027091">I am commanded only that I should serve the Lord of this city, Who has made it sacred, and His are all things; and I am commanded that I should be of these who submit;</AYA>
		<AYA id="027092">And that I should recite the Quran. Therefore whoever goes aright, he goes aright for his own soul, and whoever goes ' astray, then say: I am only one of the warners.</AYA>
		<AYA id="027093">And say: Praise be to Allah, He will show you His signs so that you shall recognize them; nor is your Lord heedless of what you do.</AYA>

		<AYA id="028001">Ta sin Mim.</AYA>
		<AYA id="028002">These are the verses of the Book that makes (things) clear.</AYA>
		<AYA id="028003">We recite to you from the account of Musa and Firon with truth for people who believe.</AYA>
		<AYA id="028004">Surely Firon exalted himself in the land and made its people into parties, weakening one party from among them; he slaughtered their sons and let their women live; surely he was one of the mischiefmakers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="028005">And We desired to bestow a favor upon those who were deemed weak in the land, and to make them the Imams, and to make them the heirs,</AYA>
		<AYA id="028006">And to grant them power in the land, and to make Firon and Haman and their hosts see from them what they feared.</AYA>
		<AYA id="028007">And We revealed to Musa's mothers, saying: Give him suck, then when you fear for him, cast him into the river and do not fear nor grieve; surely We wi!l bring him back to you and make him one of the apostles.</AYA>
		<AYA id="028008">And Firon's family took him up that he might be an enemy and a grief for them; surely Firon and Haman and their hosts were wrongdoers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="028009">And Firon's wife said: A refreshment of the eye to me and to you; do not slay him; maybe he will be useful to us, or we may take him for a son; and they did not perceive.</AYA>
		<AYA id="028010">And the heart of Musa's mother was free (from anxiety) she would have almost disclosed it had We not strengthened her heart so that she might be of the believers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="028011">And she said to his sister: Follow him up. So she watched him from a distance while they did not perceive,</AYA>
		<AYA id="028012">And We ordained that he refused to suck any foster mother before, so she said: Shall I point out to you the people of a house who will take care of him for you, and they will be benevolent to him?</AYA>
		<AYA id="028013">So We gave him back to his mother that her eye might be refreshed, and that she might no grieve, and that she might know that the promise of Allah is true, but most of them do not know.</AYA>
		<AYA id="028014">And when he attained his maturity and became full grown, We granted him wisdom and knowledge; and thus do We reward those who do good (to others).</AYA>
		<AYA id="028015">And he went into the city at a time of unvigilance on the part of its people, so he found therein two men fighting, one being of his party and the other of his foes, and he who was of his party cried out to him for help against him who was of his enemies, so Musa struck him with his fist and killed him. He said: This is on account of the Shaitan's doing; surely he is an enemy, openly leading astray.</AYA>
		<AYA id="028016">He said: My Lord! surely I have done harm to myself, so do Thou protect me. So He protected him; surely He is the Forgiving, the Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="028017">He said: My Lord! because Thou hast bestowed a favor on me, I shall never be a backer of the guilty.</AYA>
		<AYA id="028018">And he was in the city, fearing, awaiting, when lo! he who had asked his assistance the day before was crying out to him for aid. Musa said to him: You are most surely one erring manifestly.</AYA>
		<AYA id="028019">So when he desired to seize him who was an enemy to them both, he said: O Musa! do you intend to kill me as you killed a person yesterday? You desire nothing but that you should be a tyrant in the land, and you do not desire to be of those who act aright.</AYA>
		<AYA id="028020">And a man came running from the remotest part of the city. He said: O Musa! surely the chiefs are consulting together to slay you, therefore depart (at once); surely I am of those who wish well to you.</AYA>
		<AYA id="028021">So he went forth therefrom, fearing, awaiting, (and) he said: My Lord! deliver me from the unjust people.</AYA>
		<AYA id="028022">And when he turned his face towards Madyan, he said: Maybe my Lord will guide me in the right path.</AYA>
		<AYA id="028023">And when he came to the water of Madyan, he found on it a group of men watering, and he found besides them two women keeping back (their flocks). He said: What is the matter with you? They said: We cannot water until the shepherds take away (their sheep) from the water, and our father is a very old man.</AYA>
		<AYA id="028024">So he watered (their sheep) for them, then went back to the shade and said: My Lord! surely I stand in need of whatever good Thou mayest send down to me.</AYA>
		<AYA id="028025">Then one of the two women came to him walking bashfully. She said: My father invites you that he may give you the reward of your having watered for us. So when he came to him and gave to him the account, he said: Fear not, you are secure from the unjust people.</AYA>
		<AYA id="028026">Said one of them: O my father! employ him, surely the best of those that you can employ is the strong man, the faithful one.</AYA>
		<AYA id="028027">He said: I desire to marry one of these two daughters of mine to you on condition that you should serve me for eight years; but if you complete ten, it will be of your own free will, and I do not wish to be hard to you; if Allah please, you will find me one of the good.</AYA>
		<AYA id="028028">He said: This shall be (an agreement) between me and you; whichever of the two terms I fulfill, there shall be no wrongdoing to me; and Allah is a witness of what we say.</AYA>
		<AYA id="028029">So when Musa had fulfilled the term, and he journeyed with his family, he perceived on this side of the mountain a fire. He said to his family: Wait, I have seen a fire, maybe I will bring to you from it some news or a brand of fire, so that you may warm yourselves.</AYA>
		<AYA id="028030">And when he came to it, a voice was uttered from the right side of the valley in the blessed spot of the bush, saying: O Musa! surely I am Allah, the Lord of the worlds.</AYA>
		<AYA id="028031">And saying: Cast down you staff. So when he saw it in motion as if it were a serpent, he turned back retreating, and did not return. O Musa! come forward and fear not; surely you are of those who are secure;</AYA>
		<AYA id="028032">Enter your hand into the opening of your bosom, it will come forth white without evil, and draw your hand to yourself to ward off fear: so these two shall be two arguments from your Lord to Firon and his chiefs, surely they are a transgressing people.</AYA>
		<AYA id="028033">He said: My Lord! surely I killed one of them, so I fear lest they should slay me;</AYA>
		<AYA id="028034">And my brother, Haroun, he is more eloquent of tongue than I, therefore send him with me as an aider, verifying me: surely I fear that they would reject me.</AYA>
		<AYA id="028035">He said: We will strengthen your arm with your brother, and We will give you both an authority, so that they shall not reach you; (go) with Our signs; you two and those who follow you shall be uppermost.</AYA>
		<AYA id="028036">So when Musa came to them with Our clear signs, they said: This is nothing but forged enchantment, and we never heard of it amongst our fathers of old.</AYA>
		<AYA id="028037">And Musa said: My Lord knows best who comes with guidance from Him, and whose shall be the good end of the abode; surely the unjust shall not be successful</AYA>
		<AYA id="028038">And Firon said: O chiefs! I do not know of any god for you besides myself; therefore kindle a fire for me, O Haman, for brick, then prepare for me a lofty building so that I may obtain knowledge of Musa's God, and most surely I think him to be one of the liars.</AYA>
		<AYA id="028039">And he was unjustly proud in the land, he and his hosts, and they deemed that they would not be brought back to Us.</AYA>
		<AYA id="028040">So We caught hold of him and his hosts, then We cast them into the sea, and see how was the end of the unjust.</AYA>
		<AYA id="028041">And We made them Imams who call to the fire, and on the day of resurrection they shall not be assisted.</AYA>
		<AYA id="028042">And We caused a curse to follow them in this world, and on the day of resurrection they shall be of those made to appear hideous.</AYA>
		<AYA id="028043">And certainly We gave Musa the Book after We had destroyed the former generations, clear arguments for men and a guidance and a mercy, that they may be mindful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="028044">And you were not on the western side when We revealed to Musa the commandment, and you were not among the witnesses;</AYA>
		<AYA id="028045">But We raised up generations, then life became prolonged to them; and you were not dwelling among the people of Madyan, reciting to them Our communications, but We were the senders.</AYA>
		<AYA id="028046">And you were not on this side of the mountain when We called, but a mercy from your Lord that you may warn a people to whom no warner came before you, that they may be mindful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="028047">And were it not that there should befall them a disaster for what their hands have sent before, then they should say: Our Lord! why didst Thou not send to us an apostle so that we should have followed Thy communications and been of the believers !</AYA>
		<AYA id="028048">But (now) when the truth has come to them from Us, they say: Why is he not given the like of what was given to Musa? What! did they not disbelieve in what Musa was given before? They say: Two magicians backing up each other; and they say: Surely we are unbelievers in all.</AYA>
		<AYA id="028049">Say: Then bring some (other) book from Allah which is a better guide than both of them, (that) I may follow it, if you are truthful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="028050">But if they do not answer you, then know that they only follow their low desires; and who is more erring than he who follows his low desires without any guidance from Allah? Surely Allah does not guide the unjust people.</AYA>
		<AYA id="028051">And certainly We have made the word to reach them so that they may be mindful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="028052">(As to) those whom We gave the Book before it, they are believers in it.</AYA>
		<AYA id="028053">And when it is recited to them they say: We believe in it surely it is the truth from our Lord; surely we were submitters before this.</AYA>
		<AYA id="028054">These shall be granted their reward twice, because they are steadfast and they repel evil with good and spend out of what We have given them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="028055">And when they hear idle talk they turn aside from it and say: We shall have our deeds and you shall have your deeds; peace be on you, we do not desire the ignorant.</AYA>
		<AYA id="028056">Surely you cannot guide whom you love, but Allah guides whom He pleases, and He knows best the followers of the right way.</AYA>
		<AYA id="028057">And they say: If we follow the guidance with you, we shall be carried off from our country. What ! have We not settled them in a safe, sacred territory to which fruits of every kind shall be drawn?-- a sustenance from Us; but most of them do not know</AYA>
		<AYA id="028058">And how many a town have We destroyed which exulted in its means of subsistence, so these are their abodes, they have not been dwelt in after them except a little, and We are the inheritors,</AYA>
		<AYA id="028059">And your Lord never destroyed the towns until He raised in their metropolis an apostle, reciting to them Our communications, and We never destroyed the towns except when their people were unjust.</AYA>
		<AYA id="028060">And whatever things you have been given are only a provision of this world's life and its adornment, and whatever is with Allah is better and more lasting; do you not then understand?</AYA>
		<AYA id="028061">Is he to whom We have promised a goodly promise which he shall meet with like him whom We have provided with the provisions of this world's life, then on the day of resurrection he shall be of those who are brought up?</AYA>

		<AYA id="029001">Alif Lam Mim.</AYA>
		<AYA id="029002">Do men think that they will be left alone on saying, We believe, and not be tried?</AYA>
		<AYA id="029003">And certainly We tried those before them, so Allah will certainly know those who are true and He will certainly know the liars.</AYA>
		<AYA id="029004">Or do they who work evil think that they will escape Us? Evil is it that they judge!</AYA>
		<AYA id="029005">Whoever hopes to meet Allah, the term appointed by Allah will then most surely come; and He is the Hearing, the Knowing.</AYA>
		<AYA id="029006">And whoever strives hard, he strives only for his own soul; most surely Allah is Self-sufficient, above (need of) the worlds.</AYA>
		<AYA id="029007">And (as for) those who believe and do good, We will most certainly do away with their evil deeds and We will most certainly reward them the best of what they did.</AYA>
		<AYA id="029008">And We have enjoined on man goodness to his parents, and if they contend with you that you should associate (others) with Me, of which you have no knowledge, do not obey them, to Me is your return, so I will inform you of what you did.</AYA>
		<AYA id="029009">And (as for) those who believe and do good, We will most surely cause them to enter among the good.</AYA>
		<AYA id="029010">And among men is he who says: We believe in Allah; but when he is persecuted in (the way of) Allah he thinks the persecution of men to be as the chastisement of Allah; and if there come assistance from your Lord, they would most certainly say: Surely we were with you. What! is not Allah the best knower of what is in the breasts of mankind.</AYA>
		<AYA id="029011">And most certainly Allah will know those who believe and most certainly He will know the hypocrites.</AYA>
		<AYA id="029012">And those who disbelieve say to those who believe: Follow our path and we will bear your wrongs. And never shall they be the bearers of any of their wrongs; most surely they are liars.</AYA>
		<AYA id="029013">And most certainly they shall carry their own burdens, and other burdens with their own burdens, and most certainly they shall be questioned on the resurrection day as to what they forged.</AYA>
		<AYA id="029014">And certainly We sent Nuh to his people, so he remained among them a thousand years save fifty years. And the deluge overtook them, while they were unjust</AYA>
		<AYA id="029015">So We delivered him and the inmates of the ark, and made it a sign to the nations.</AYA>
		<AYA id="029016">And (We sent) Ibrahim, when he said to his people: Serve Allah and be careful of (your duty to) Him; this is best for you, if you did but know:</AYA>
		<AYA id="029017">You only worship idols besides Allah and you create a lie surely they whom you serve besides Allah do not control for you any sustenance, therefore seek the sustenance from Allah and serve Him and be grateful to Him; to Him you shall be brought back.</AYA>
		<AYA id="029018">And if you reject (the truth), nations before you did indeed reject (the truth); and nothing is incumbent on the apostle but a plain delivering (of the message).</AYA>
		<AYA id="029019">What! do they not consider how Allah originates the creation, then reproduces it? Surely that is easy to Allah.</AYA>
		<AYA id="029020">Say: Travel in the earth and see how He makes the first creation, then Allah creates the latter creation; surely Allah has power over all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="029021">He punishes whom He pleases and has mercy on whom He pleases, and to Him you shall be turned back.</AYA>
		<AYA id="029022">And you shall not escape in the earth nor in the heaven, and you have neither a protector nor a helper besides Allah.</AYA>
		<AYA id="029023">And (as to) those who disbelieve in the communications of Allah and His meeting, they have despaired of My mercy, and these it is that shall have a painful punishment.</AYA>
		<AYA id="029024">So naught was the answer of his people except that they said: Slay him or burn him; then Allah delivered him from the fire; most surely there are signs in this for a people who believe.</AYA>
		<AYA id="029025">And he said: You have only taken for yourselves idols besides Allah by way of friendship between you in this world's life, then on the resurrection day some of you shall deny others, and some of you shall curse others, and your abode is the fire, and you shall not have any helpers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="029026">And Lut believed in Him, and he said: I am fleeing to my Lord, surely He is the Mighty, the Wise.</AYA>
		<AYA id="029027">And We granted him Ishaq and Yaqoub, and caused the t prophethood and the book to remain in his seed, and We gave him his reward in this world, and in the hereafter he will most surely be among the good.</AYA>
		<AYA id="029028">And (We sent) Lut when he said to his people: Most surely you are guilty of an indecency which none of the nations has ever done before you;</AYA>
		<AYA id="029029">What! do you come to the males and commit robbery on the highway, and you commit evil deeds in your assemblies? But nothing was the answer of his people except that they said: Bring on us Allah's punishment, if you are one of the truthful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="029030">He said: My Lord! help me against the mischievous people.</AYA>
		<AYA id="029031">And when Our messengers came to Ibrahim with the good news, they said: Surely we are going to destroy the people of this town, for its people are unjust.</AYA>
		<AYA id="029032">He said: Surely in it is Lut. They said: We know well who is in it; we shall certainly deliver him and his followers, except his wife; she shall be of those who remain behind.</AYA>
		<AYA id="029033">And when Our messengers came to Lut he was grieved on account of them, and he felt powerless (to protect) them; and they said: Fear not, nor grieve; surely we will deliver you and your followers, except your wife; she shall be of those who remain behind.</AYA>
		<AYA id="029034">Surely We will cause to come down upon the people of this town a punishment from heaven, because they transgressed.</AYA>
		<AYA id="029035">And certainly We have left a clear sign of it for a people who understand.</AYA>
		<AYA id="029036">And to Madyan (We sent) their brother Shuaib, so he said: O my people! serve Allah and fear the latter day and do not act corruptly in the land, making mischief</AYA>
		<AYA id="029037">But they rejected him, so a severe earthquake overtook them, and they became motionless bodies in their abode.</AYA>
		<AYA id="029038">And (We destroyed) Ad and Samood, and from their dwellings (this) is apparent to you indeed; and the Shaitan made their deeds fair-seeming to them, so he kept them back from the path, though they were endowed with intelligence and skill,</AYA>
		<AYA id="029039">And (We destroyed) Qaroun and Firon and Haman; and certainly Musa came to them with clear arguments, but they behaved haughtily in the land; yet they could not outstrip (Us).</AYA>
		<AYA id="029040">So each We punished for his sin; of them was he on whom We sent down a violent storm, and of them was he whom the rumbling overtook, and of them was he whom We made to be swallowed up by the earth, and of them was he whom We drowned; and it did not beseem Allah that He should be unjust to them, but they were unjust to their own souls.</AYA>
		<AYA id="029041">The parable of those who take guardians besides Allah is as the parable of the spider that makes for itself a house; and most surely the frailest of the houses is the spider's house did they but know.</AYA>
		<AYA id="029042">Surely Allah knows whatever thing they call upon besides Him; and He is the Mighty, the Wise.</AYA>
		<AYA id="029043">And (as for) these examples, We set them forth for men, and none understand them but the learned.</AYA>
		<AYA id="029044">Allah created the heavens and the earth with truth; most surely there is a sign in this for the believers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="029045">Recite that which has been revealed to you of the Book and keep up prayer; surely prayer keeps (one) away from indecency and evil, and certainly the remembrance of Allah is the greatest, and Allah knows what you do.</AYA>
		<AYA id="029046">And do not dispute with the followers of the Book except by what is best, except those of them who act unjustly, and say: We believe in that which has been revealed to us and revealed to you, and our God and your God is One, and to Him do we submit.</AYA>
		<AYA id="029047">And thus have We revealed the Book to you. So those whom We have given the Book believe in it, and of these there are those who believe in it, and none deny Our communications except the unbelievers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="029048">And you did not recite before it any book, nor did you transcribe one with your right hand, for then could those who say untrue things have doubted.</AYA>
		<AYA id="029049">Nay! these are clear communications in the breasts of those who are granted knowledge; and none deny Our communications except the unjust.</AYA>
		<AYA id="029050">And they say: Why are not signs sent down upon him from his Lord? Say: The signs are only with Allah, and I am only a plain warner.</AYA>
		<AYA id="029051">Is it not enough for them that We have revealed to you the Book which is recited to them? Most surely there is mercy in this and a reminder for a people who believe.</AYA>
		<AYA id="029052">Say: Allah is sufficient as a witness between me and you; He knows what is in the heavens and the earth. And (as for) those who believe in the falsehood and disbelieve in Allah, these it is that are the losers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="029053">And they ask you to hasten on the chastisement; and had not a term been appointed, the chastisement would certainly have come to them; and most certainly it will come to them all of a sudden while they will not perceive.</AYA>
		<AYA id="029054">They ask you to hasten on the chastisement, and most surely hell encompasses the unbelievers;</AYA>
		<AYA id="029055">On the day when the chastisement shall cover them from above them, and from beneath their feet; and He shall say: Taste what you did.</AYA>
		<AYA id="029056">O My servants who believe! surely My earth is vast, therefore Me alone should you serve.</AYA>
		<AYA id="029057">Every soul must taste of death, then to Us you shall be brought back.</AYA>
		<AYA id="029058">And (as for) those who believe and do good, We will certainly give them abode in the high places in gardens beneath which rivers flow, abiding therein; how good the reward of the workers:</AYA>
		<AYA id="029059">Those who are patient, and on their Lord do they rely.</AYA>
		<AYA id="029060">And how many a living creature that does not carry its sustenance: Allah sustains it and yourselves; and He is the Hearing, the Knowing.</AYA>
		<AYA id="029061">And if you ask them, Who created the heavens and the earth and made the sun and the moon subservient, they will certainly say, Allah. Whence are they then turned away?</AYA>
		<AYA id="029062">Allah makes abundant the means of subsistence for whom He pleases of His servants, and straitens them for whom (He pleases) surely Allah is Cognizant of all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="029063">And if you ask them Who is it that sends down water from the clouds, then gives life to the earth with it after its death, they will certainly say, Allah. Say: All praise is due to Allah. Nay, most of them do not understand</AYA>
		<AYA id="029064">And this life of the world is nothing but a sport and a play; and as for the next abode, that most surely is the life-- did they but know!</AYA>
		<AYA id="029065">So when they ride in the ships they call upon Allah, being sincerely obedient to Him, but when He brings them safe to the land, lo! they associate others (with Him);</AYA>
		<AYA id="029066">Thus they become ungrateful for what We have given them, so that they may enjoy; but they shall soon know.</AYA>
		<AYA id="029067">Do they not see that We have made a sacred territory secure, while men are carried off by force from around them? Will they still believe in the falsehood and disbelieve in the favour of Allah?</AYA>
		<AYA id="029068">And who is more unjust than one who forges a lie against Allah, or gives the lie to the truth when it has come to him? Will not in hell be the abode of the unbelievers?</AYA>
		<AYA id="029069">And (as for) those who strive hard for Us, We will most certainly guide them in Our ways; and Allah is most surely with the doers of good.</AYA>

		<AYA id="030016">And as to those who disbelieved and rejected Our communications and the meeting of the hereafter, these shall be brought over to the chastisement.</AYA>
		<AYA id="030017">Therefore glory be to Allah when you enter upon the time of the evening and when you enter upon the time of the morning.</AYA>
		<AYA id="030018">And to Him belongs praise in the heavens and the earth, and at nightfall and when you are at midday.</AYA>
		<AYA id="030019">He brings forth the living from the dead and brings forth the dead from the living, and gives life to the earth after its death, and thus shall you be brought forth.</AYA>
		<AYA id="030020">And one of His signs is that He created you from dust, then lo! you are mortals (who) scatter.</AYA>
		<AYA id="030021">And one of His signs is that He created mates for you from yourselves that you may find rest in them, and He put between you love and compassion; most surely there are signs in this for a people who reflect.</AYA>
		<AYA id="030022">And one of His signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth and the diversity of your tongues and colors; most surely there are signs in this for the learned.</AYA>
		<AYA id="030023">And one of His signs is your sleeping and your seeking of His grace by night and (by) day; most surely there are signs in this for a people who would hear.</AYA>
		<AYA id="030024">And one of His signs is that He shows you the lightning for fear and for hope, and sends down water from the clouds then gives life therewith to the earth after its death; most surely there are signs in this for a people who understand</AYA>
		<AYA id="030025">And one of His signs is that the heaven and the earth subsist by His command, then when He calls you with a (single) call from out of the earth, lo! you come forth.</AYA>
		<AYA id="030026">And His is whosoever is in the heavens and the earth; all are obedient to Him</AYA>
		<AYA id="030027">And He it is Who originates the creation, then reproduces it, and it is easy to Him; and His are the most exalted attributes in the heavens and the earth, and He is the Mighty, the Wise.</AYA>
		<AYA id="030028">He sets forth to you a parable relating to yourselves: Have you among those whom your right hands possess partners in what We have given you for sustenance, so that with respect to it you are alike; you fear them as you fear each other? Thus do We make the communications distinct for a people who understand.</AYA>
		<AYA id="030029">Nay! those who are unjust follow their low desires without any knowledge; so who can guide him whom Allah makes err? And they shall have no helpers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="030030">Then set your face upright for religion in the right state-- the nature made by Allah in which He has made men; there is no altering of Allah's creation; that is the right religion, but most people do not know--</AYA>
		<AYA id="030031">Turning to Him, and be careful of (your duty to) Him and keep up prayer and be not of the polytheists</AYA>
		<AYA id="030032">Of those who divided their religion and became seas every sect rejoicing in what they had with them</AYA>
		<AYA id="030033">And when harm afflicts men, they call upon their Lord, turning to Him, then when He makes them taste of mercy from Him, lo! some of them begin to associate (others) with their Lord,</AYA>
		<AYA id="030034">So as to be ungrateful for what We have given them; but enjoy yourselves (for a while), for you shall soon come to know.</AYA>
		<AYA id="030035">Or, have We sent down upon them an authority so that it speaks of that which they associate with Him?</AYA>
		<AYA id="030036">And when We make people taste of mercy they rejoice in it, and if an evil befall them for what their hands have already wrought, lo! they are in despair.</AYA>
		<AYA id="030037">Do they not see that Allah makes ample provision for whom He pleases, or straitens? Most surely there are signs in this for a people who believe.</AYA>
		<AYA id="030038">Then give to the near of kin his due, and to the needy and the wayfarer; this is best for those who desire Allah's pleasure, and these it is who are successful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="030039">And whatever you lay out as usury, so that it may increase in the property of men, it shall not increase with Allah; and whatever you give in charity, desiring Allah's pleasure-- it is these (persons) that shall get manifold.</AYA>
		<AYA id="030040">Allah is He Who created you, then gave you sustenance, then He causes you to die, then brings you to life. Is there any of your associate-gods who does aught of it? Glory be to Him, and exalted be He above what they associate (with Him).</AYA>
		<AYA id="030041">Corruption has appeared in the land and the sea on account of what the hands of men have wrought, that He may make them taste a part of that which they have done, so that they may return.</AYA>
		<AYA id="030042">Say: Travel in the land, then see how was the end of those before; most of them were polytheists.</AYA>
		<AYA id="030043">Then turn thy face straight to the right religion before there come from Allah the day which cannot be averted; on that day they shall become separated.</AYA>
		<AYA id="030044">Whoever disbelieves, he shall be responsible for his disbelief, and whoever does good, they prepare (good) for their own souls,</AYA>
		<AYA id="030045">That He may reward those who believe and do good out of His grace; surely He does not love the unbelievers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="030046">And one of His signs is that He sends forth the winds bearing good news, and that He may make your taste of His mercy, and that the ships may run by His command, and that you may seek of His grace, and that you may be grateful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="030047">And certainly We sent before you apostles to their people, so they came to them with clear arguments, then We gave the punishment to those who were guilty; and helping the believers is ever incumbent on Us.</AYA>
		<AYA id="030048">Allah is he Who sends forth the winds so they raise a cloud, then He spreads it forth in the sky as He pleases, and He breaks it up so that you see the rain coming forth from inside it; then when He causes it to fall upon whom He pleases of His servants, lo! they are joyful</AYA>
		<AYA id="030049">Though they were before this, before it was sent down upon them, confounded in sure despair.</AYA>
		<AYA id="030050">Look then at the signs of Allah's mercy, how He gives life to the earth after its death, most surely He will raise the dead to life; and He has power over all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="030051">And if We send a wind and they see it to be yellow, they would after that certainly continue to disbelieve</AYA>
		<AYA id="030052">For surely you cannot, make the dead to hear and you cannot make the deaf to hear the call, when they turn back and</AYA>
		<AYA id="030053">Nor can you lead away the blind out of their error. You cannot make to hear any but those who believe in Our communications so they shall submit.</AYA>
		<AYA id="030054">Allah is He Who created you from a state of weakness then He gave strength after weakness, then ordained weakness and hoary hair after strength; He creates what He pleases, and He is the Knowing, the Powerful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="030055">And at the time when the hour shall come, the guilty shall swear (that) they did not tarry but an hour; thus are they ever turned away.</AYA>
		<AYA id="030056">And those who are given knowledge and faith will say: Certainly you tarried according to the ordinance of Allah till the day of resurrection, so this is the day of resurrection, but you did not know.</AYA>
		<AYA id="030057">But on that day their excuse shall not profit those who were unjust, nor shall they be regarded with goodwill.</AYA>
		<AYA id="030058">And certainly We have set forth for men every kind of example in this Quran; and if you should bring them a communication, those who disbelieve would certainly say: You are naught but false claimants.</AYA>
		<AYA id="030059">Thus does Allah set a seal on the hearts of those who do not know.</AYA>
		<AYA id="030060">Therefore be patient; surely the promise of Allah is true and let not those who have no certainty hold you in light estimation.</AYA>

		<AYA id="032004">Allah is He Who created the heavens and the earth and what is between them in six periods, and He mounted the throne (of authority); you have not besides Him any guardian or any intercessor, will you not then mind?</AYA>
		<AYA id="032005">He regulates the affair from the heaven to the earth; then shall it ascend to Him in a day the measure of which is a thousand years of what you count.</AYA>
		<AYA id="032006">This is the Knower of the unseen and the seen, the Mighty the Merciful,</AYA>
		<AYA id="032007">Who made good everything that He has created, and He began the creation of man from dust.</AYA>

		<AYA id="033005">Assert their relationship to their fathers; this is more equitable with Allah; but if you do not know their fathers, then they are your brethren in faith and your friends; and there is no blame on you concerning that in which you made a mistake, but (concerning) that which your hearts do purposely (blame may rest on you), and Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="033006">The Prophet has a greater claim on the faithful than they have on themselves, and his wives are (as) their mothers; and the possessors of relationship have the better claim in the ordinance of Allah to inheritance, one with respect to another, than (other) believers, and (than) those who have fled (their homes), except that you do some good to your friends; this is written in the Book.</AYA>

		<AYA id="033044">Their salutation on the day that they meet Him shall be, Peace, and He has prepared for them an honourable reward.</AYA>
		<AYA id="033045">O Prophet! surely We have sent you as a witness, and as a bearer of good news and as a warner,</AYA>
		<AYA id="033046">And as one inviting to Allah by His permission, and as a light-giving torch.</AYA>
		<AYA id="033047">And give to the believers the good news that they shall have a great grace from Allah.</AYA>
		<AYA id="033048">And be not compliant to the unbelievers and the hypocrites, and leave unregarded their annoying talk, and rely on Allah; and Allah is sufficient as a Protector</AYA>
		<AYA id="033049">O you who believe! when you marry the believing women, then divorce them before you touch them, you have in their case no term which you should reckon; so make some provision for them and send them forth a goodly sending forth.</AYA>
		<AYA id="033050">O Prophet! surely We have made lawful to you your wives whom you have given their dowries, and those whom your right hand possesses out of those whom Allah has given to you as prisoners of war, and the daughters of your paternal uncles and the daughters of your paternal aunts, and the daughters of your maternal uncles and the daughters of your maternal aunts who fled with you; and a believing woman if she gave herself to the Prophet, if the Prophet desired to marry her-- specially for you, not for the (rest of) believers; We know what We have ordained for them concerning their wives and those whom their right hands possess in order that no blame may attach to you; and Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="033051">You may put off whom you please of them, and you may take to you whom you please, and whom you desire of those whom you had separated provisionally; no blame attaches to you; this is most proper, so that their eyes may be cool and they may not grieve, and that they should be pleased, all of them with what you give them, and Allah knows what is in your hearts; and Allah is Knowing, Forbearing.</AYA>
		<AYA id="033052">It is not allowed to you to take women afterwards, nor that you should change them for other wives, though their beauty be pleasing to you, except what your right hand possesses and Allah is Watchful over all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="033053">O you who believe! do not enter the houses of the Prophet unless permission is given to you for a meal, not waiting for its cooking being finished-- but when you are invited, enter, and when you have taken the food, then disperse-- not seeking to listen to talk; surely this gives the Prophet trouble, but he forbears from you, and Allah does not forbear from the truth And when you ask of them any goods, ask of them from behind a curtain; this is purer for your hearts and (for) their hearts; and it does not behove you that you should give trouble to the Apostle of Allah, nor that you should marry his wives after him ever; surely this is grievous in the sight of Allah.</AYA>
		<AYA id="033054">If you do a thing openly or do it in secret, then surely Allah is Cognizant of all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="033055">There is no blame on them in respect of their fathers, nor their brothers, nor their brothers' sons, nor their sisters' sons nor their own women, nor of what their right hands possess; and be careful of (your duty to) Allah; surely Allah is a witness of all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="033056">Surely Allah and His angels bless the Prophet; O you who believe! call for (Divine) blessings on him and salute him with a (becoming) salutation.</AYA>
		<AYA id="033057">Surely (as for) those who speak evil things of Allah and His Apostle, Allah has cursed them in this world and the here after, and He has prepared for them a chastisement bringing disgrace.</AYA>
		<AYA id="033058">And those who speak evil things of the believing men and the believing women without their having earned (it), they are guilty indeed of a false accusation and a manifest sin.</AYA>
		<AYA id="033059">O Prophet! say to your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers that they let down upon them their over-garments; this will be more proper, that they may be known, and thus they will not be given trouble; and Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="033060">If the hypocrites and those in whose hearts is a disease and the agitators in the city do not desist, We shall most certainly set you over them, then they shall not be your neighbors in it but for a little while;</AYA>
		<AYA id="033061">Cursed: wherever they are found they shall be seized and murdered, a (horrible) murdering.</AYA>
		<AYA id="033062">(Such has been) the course of Allah with respect to those who have gone before; and you shall not find any change in the course of Allah.</AYA>
		<AYA id="033063">Men ask you about the hour; say: The knowledge of it is only with Allah, and what will make you comprehend that the : hour may be nigh.</AYA>
		<AYA id="033064">Surely Allah has cursed the unbelievers and has prepared for them a burning fire,</AYA>
		<AYA id="033065">To abide therein for a long time; they shall not find a protector or a helper.</AYA>
		<AYA id="033066">On the day when their faces shall be turned back into the fire, they shall say: O would that we had obeyed Allah and obeyed the Apostle!</AYA>
		<AYA id="033067">And they shall say: O our Lord! surely we obeyed our leaders and our great men, so they led us astray from the path;</AYA>
		<AYA id="033068">O our Lord! give them a double punishment and curse them with a great curse</AYA>
		<AYA id="033069">O you who believe! be not like those who spoke evil things of Musa, but Allah cleared him of what they said, and he was worthy of regard with Allah.</AYA>
		<AYA id="033070">O you who believe! be careful of(your duty to) Allah and speak the right word,</AYA>
		<AYA id="033071">He will put your deeds into a right state for you, and forgive you your faults; and whoever obeys Allah and His Apostle, he indeed achieves a mighty success.</AYA>
		<AYA id="033072">Surely We offered the trust to the heavens and the earth and the mountains, but they refused to be unfaithful to it and feared from it, and man has turned unfaithful to it; surely he is unjust, ignorant;</AYA>
		<AYA id="033073">So Allah will chastise the hypocritical men and the hypocritical women and the polytheistic men and the polytheistic women, and Allah will turn (mercifully) to the believing women, and Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.</AYA>

		<AYA id="034003">And those who disbelieve say: The hour shall not come upon us. Say: Yea! by my Lord, the Knower of the unseen, it shall certainly come upon you; not the weight of an atom becomes absent from Him, in the heavens or in the earth, and neither less than that nor greater, but (all) is in a clear book</AYA>
		<AYA id="034004">That He may reward those who believe and do good; these it is for whom is forgiveness and an honorable sustenance.</AYA>

		<AYA id="034007">And those who disbelieve say: Shall we point out to you a man who informs you that when you are scattered the utmost scattering you shall then be most surely (raised) in (to) a new creation?</AYA>
		<AYA id="034008">He has forged a lie against Allah or there is madness in him. Nay! those who do not believe in the hereafter are in torment and in great error.</AYA>
		<AYA id="034009">Do they not then consider what is before them and what is behind them of the heaven and the earth? If We please We will make them disappear in the land or bring down upon them a portion from the heaven; most surely there is a sign in this for every servant turning (to Allah).</AYA>
		<AYA id="034010">And certainly We gave to Dawood excellence from Us: O mountains! sing praises with him, and the birds; and We made the iron pliant to him,</AYA>
		<AYA id="034011">Saying: Make ample (coats of mail), and assign a time to the making of coats of mail and do good; surely I am Seeing what you do.</AYA>
		<AYA id="034012">And (We made) the wind (subservient) to Sulaiman, which made a month's journey in the morning and a month's journey m the evening, and We made a fountain of molten copper to flow out for him, and of the jinn there were those who worked before him by the command of his Lord; and whoever turned aside from Our command from among them, We made him taste of the punishment of burning.</AYA>
		<AYA id="034013">They made for him what he pleased of fortresses and images, and bowls (large) as watering-troughs and cooking-pots that will not move from their place; give thanks, O family of Dawood! and very few of My servants are grateful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="034014">But when We decreed death for him, naught showed them his death but a creature of the earth that ate away his staff; and when it fell down, the jinn came to know plainly that if they had known the unseen, they would not have tarried in abasing torment.</AYA>
		<AYA id="034015">Certainly there was a sign for Saba in their abode; two gardens on the right and the left; eat of the sustenance of your Lord and give thanks to Him: a good land and a Forgiving Lord!</AYA>
		<AYA id="034016">But they turned aside, so We sent upon them a torrent of which the rush could not be withstood, and in place of their two gardens We gave to them two gardens yielding bitter fruit and (growing) tamarisk and a few lote-trees.</AYA>
		<AYA id="034017">This We requited them with because they disbelieved; and We do not punish any but the ungrateful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="034018">And We made between them and the towns which We had blessed (other) towns to be easily seen, and We apportioned the journey therein: Travel through them nights and days, secure.</AYA>
		<AYA id="034019">And they said: O our Lord! make spaces to be longer between our journeys; and they were unjust to themselves so We made them stories and scattered them with an utter scattering; most surely there are signs in this for every patient, grateful one</AYA>
		<AYA id="034020">And certainly the Shaitan found true his conjecture concerning them, so they follow him, except a party of the believers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="034021">And he has no authority over them, but that We may distinguish him who believes in the hereafter from him who is in doubt concerning it; and your Lord is the Preserver of all things</AYA>
		<AYA id="034022">Say: Call upon those whom you assert besides Allah; they do not control the weight of an atom in the heavens or in the earth nor have they any partnership in either, nor has He among them any one to back (Him) up.</AYA>
		<AYA id="034023">And intercession will not avail aught with Him save of him whom He permits. Until when fear shall be removed from their hearts, They shall say: What is it that your Lord said? They shall say: The truth. And He is the Most High, the Great.</AYA>

		<AYA id="034026">Say: Our Lord will gather us together, then will He judge between us with the truth; and He is the greatest Judge, the All-knowing.</AYA>
		<AYA id="034027">Say: Show me those whom you have joined with Him as associates; by no means (can you do it). Nay! He is Allah, the Mighty, the Wise.</AYA>
		<AYA id="034028">And We have not sent you but to all the men as a bearer of good news and as a warner, but most men do not know.</AYA>
		<AYA id="034029">And they say: When will this promise be (fulfilled) if you are truthful?</AYA>
		<AYA id="034030">Say: You have the appointment of a day from which you cannot hold back any while, nor can you bring it on.</AYA>
		<AYA id="034031">And those who disbelieve say: By no means will we believe in this Quran, nor in that which is before it; and could you see when the unjust shall be made to stand before their Lord, bandying words one with another! Those who were reckoned weak shall say to those who were proud: Had it not been for you we would certainly have been believers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="034032">Those who were proud shall say to those who were deemed weak: Did we turn you away from the guidance after it had come to you? Nay, you (yourselves) were guilty</AYA>
		<AYA id="034033">And those who were deemed weak shall say to those who were proud. Nay, (it was) planning by night and day when you told us to disbelieve in Allah and to set up likes with Him. And they shall conceal regret when they shall see the punishment; and We will put shackles on the necks of those who disbelieved; they shall not be requited but what they did.</AYA>
		<AYA id="034034">And We never sent a warner to a town but those who led lives in ease in it said: We are surely disbelievers in what you are sent with.</AYA>
		<AYA id="034035">And they say: We have more wealth and children, and we shall not be punished.</AYA>
		<AYA id="034036">Say: Surely my Lord amplifies the means of subsistence for whom He pleases and straitens (for whom He pleases), but most men do not know.</AYA>
		<AYA id="034037">And not your wealth nor your children, are the things which bring you near Us in station, but whoever believes and does good, these it is for whom is a double reward for what they do, and they shall be secure in the highest places.</AYA>
		<AYA id="034038">And (as for) those who strive in opposing Our communications, they shall be caused to be brought to the chastisement.</AYA>
		<AYA id="034039">Say: Surely my Lord amplifies the means of subsistence for whom He pleases of His servants and straitens (them) for whom (He pleases), and whatever thing you spend, He exceeds It m reward, and He is the best of Sustainers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="034040">And on the day when He will gather them all together, then will He say to the angels: Did these worship you?</AYA>
		<AYA id="034041">They shall say: Glory be to Thee! Thou art our Guardian, not they; nay! they worshipped the jinn; most of them were believers in them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="034042">So on that day one of you shall not control profit or harm for another, and We will say to those who were unjust: Taste the chastisement of the fire which you called a lie.</AYA>
		<AYA id="034043">And when Our clear communications are recited to them, they say: This is naught but a man who desires to turn you away from that which your fathers worshipped. And they say: This is naught but a lie that is forged. And those who disbelieve say of the truth when it comes to them: This is only clear enchantment.</AYA>
		<AYA id="034044">And We have not given them any books which they read, nor did We send to them before you a warner.</AYA>
		<AYA id="034045">And those before them rejected (the truth), and these have not yet attained a tenth of what We gave them, but they gave the lie to My apostles, then how was the manifestation of My disapproval?</AYA>
		<AYA id="034046">Say: I exhort you only to one thing, that rise up for Allah's sake in twos and singly, then ponder: there is no madness in your fellow-citizen; he is only a warner to you before a severe chastisement.</AYA>
		<AYA id="034047">Say: Whatever reward I have asked of you, that is only for yourselves; my reward is only with Allah, and He is a witness of all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="034048">Say: Surely my Lord utters the truth, the great Knower of the unseen.</AYA>
		<AYA id="034049">Say: The truth has come, and the falsehood shall vanish and shall not come back.</AYA>
		<AYA id="034050">Say: If I err, I err only against my own soul, and if I follow a right direction, it ?s because of what my Lord reveals to me; surely He is Hearing, Nigh.</AYA>

		<AYA id="035001">All praise is due to Allah, the Originator of the heavens and the earth, the Maker of the angels, messengers flying on wings, two, and three, and four; He increases in creation what He pleases; surely Allah has power over all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="035002">Whatever Allah grants to men of (His) mercy, there is none to withhold it, and what He withholds there is none to send it forth after that, and He is the Mighty, the Wise</AYA>
		<AYA id="035003">O men! call to mind the favor of Allah on you; is there any creator besides Allah who gives you sustenance from the heaven and the earth? There is no god but He; whence are you then turned away?</AYA>
		<AYA id="035004">And if they call you a liar, truly apostles before you were called liars, and to Allah are all affairs returned.</AYA>
		<AYA id="035005">O men! surely the promise of Allah is true, therefore let not the life of this world deceive you, and let not the archdeceiver deceive you respecting Allah.</AYA>
		<AYA id="035006">Surely the Shaitan is your enemy, so take him for an enemy; he only invites his party that they may be inmates of the burning</AYA>
		<AYA id="035007">(As for) those who disbelieve, they shall have a severe punishment, and (as for) those who believe and do good, they shall have forgiveness and a great reward.</AYA>
		<AYA id="035008">What! is he whose evil deed is made fairseeming to him so much so that he considers it good? Now surely Allah makes err whom He pleases and guides aright whom He pleases, so let not your soul waste away in grief for them; surely Allah is Cognizant of what they do</AYA>
		<AYA id="035009">And Allah is He Who sends the winds so they raise a cloud, then We drive it on to a dead country, and therewith We give life to the earth after its death; even so is the quickening.</AYA>
		<AYA id="035010">Whoever desires honor, then to Allah belongs the honor wholly. To Him do ascend the good words; and the good deeds, lift them up, and (as for) those who plan evil deeds, they shall have a severe chastisement; and (as for) their plan, it shall perish.</AYA>
		<AYA id="035011">And Allah created you of dust, then of the life-germ, then He made you pairs; and no female bears, nor does she bring forth, except with His knowledge; and no one whose life is lengthened has his life lengthened, nor is aught diminished of one's life, but it is all in a book; surely this is easy to Allah.</AYA>
		<AYA id="035012">And the two seas are not alike: the one sweet, that subdues thirst by its excessive sweetness, pleasant to drink; and the other salt, that burns by its saltness; yet from each of them you eat fresh flesh and bring forth ornaments which you wear; and you see the ships cleave through it that you may seek of His bounty and that you may be grateful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="035013">He causes the night to enter in upon the day, and He causes the day to enter in upon the night, and He has made subservient (to you) the sun and the moon; each one follows its course to an appointed time; this is Allah, your Lord, His is the kingdom; and those whom you call upon besides Him do not control a straw.</AYA>
		<AYA id="035014">If you call on them they shall not hear your call, and even if they could hear they shall not answer you; and on the resurrection day they will deny your associating them (with Allah); and none can inform you like the One Who is Aware.</AYA>
		<AYA id="035015">O men! you are they who stand in need of Allah, and Allah is He Who is the Self-sufficient, the Praised One.</AYA>
		<AYA id="035016">If He please, He will take you off and bring a new generation.</AYA>
		<AYA id="035017">And this is not hard to Allah.</AYA>
		<AYA id="035018">And a burdened soul cannot bear the burden of another and if one weighed down by burden should cry for (another to carry) its burden, not aught of it shall be carried, even though he be near of kin. You warn only those who fear their Lord in secret and keep up prayer; and whoever purifies himself, he purifies himself only for (the good of) his own soul; and to Allah is the eventual coming.</AYA>
		<AYA id="035019">And the blind and the seeing are not alike</AYA>

		<AYA id="035021">Nor the shade and the heat,</AYA>
		<AYA id="035022">Neither are the living and the dead alike. Surely Allah makes whom He pleases hear, and you cannot make those hear who are m the graves.</AYA>
		<AYA id="035023">You are naught but a warner.</AYA>
		<AYA id="035024">Surely We have sent you with the truth as a bearer of good news and a warner; and there is not a people but a warner has gone among them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="035025">And if they call you a liar, so did those before them indeed call (their apostles) liars; their apostles had come to them with clear arguments, and with scriptures, and with the illuminating book.</AYA>
		<AYA id="035026">Then did I punish those who disbelieved, so how was the manifestation of My disapproval?</AYA>
		<AYA id="035027">Do you not see that Allah sends down water from the cloud, then We bring forth therewith fruits of various colors; and in the mountains are streaks, white and red, of various hues and (others) intensely black?</AYA>
		<AYA id="035028">And of men and beasts and cattle are various species of it likewise; those of His servants only who are possessed of knowledge fear Allah; surely Allah is Mighty, Forgiving.</AYA>
		<AYA id="035029">Surely they who recite the Book of Allah and keep up prayer and spend out of what We have given them secretly and openly, hope for a gain which will not perish.</AYA>
		<AYA id="035030">That He may pay them back fully their rewards and give them more out of His grace: surely He is Forgiving, Multiplier of rewards.</AYA>
		<AYA id="035031">And that which We have revealed to you of the Book, that is the truth verifying that which is before it; most surely with respect to His servants Allah is Aware, Seeing</AYA>
		<AYA id="035032">Then We gave the Book for an inheritance to those whom We chose from among Our servants; but of them is he who makes his soul to suffer a loss, and of them is he who takes a middle course, and of them is he who is foremost in deeds of goodness by Allah's permission; this is the great excellence.</AYA>
		<AYA id="035033">Gardens of perpetuity, they shall enter therein; they shad be made to wear therein bracelets of gold and pearls, and their dress therein shall be silk.</AYA>
		<AYA id="035034">And they shall say: (All) praise is due to Allah, Who has made grief to depart from us; most surely our Lord is Forgiving, Multiplier of rewards,</AYA>
		<AYA id="035035">Who has made us alight in a house abiding for ever out of . His grace; toil shall not touch us therein, nor shall fatigue therein afflict us.</AYA>
		<AYA id="035036">And (as for) those who disbelieve, for them is the fire of hell; it shall not be finished with them entirely so that they should die, nor shall the chastisement thereof be lightened to them: even thus do We retribute every ungrateful one.</AYA>
		<AYA id="035037">And they shall cry therein for succour: O our Lord ! take us out, we will do good deeds other than those which we used to do. Did We not preserve you alive long enough, so that he who would be mindful in it should mind? And there came to you the warner; therefore taste; because for the unjust, there is no helper.</AYA>
		<AYA id="035038">Surely Allah is the Knower of what is unseen m the heavens and the earth; surely He is Cognizant of what IS m the hearts.</AYA>
		<AYA id="035039">He it is Who made you rulers in the land; therefore whoever disbelieves, his unbelief is against himself; and their unbelief does not increase the disbelievers with their Lord in anything except hatred; and their unbelief does not increase the disbelievers m anything except loss.</AYA>
		<AYA id="035040">Say: Have you considered your associates which you call upon besides Allah? Show me what part of the earth they have created, or have they any share in the heavens; or, have We given them a book so that they follow a clear argument thereof? Nay, the unjust do not hold out promises one to another but only to deceive.</AYA>
		<AYA id="035041">Surely Allah upholds the heavens and the earth lest they come to naught; and if they should come to naught, there Is none who can uphold them after Him; surely He is the Forbearing, the Forgiving.</AYA>
		<AYA id="035042">And they swore by Allah with the strongest of their oaths that if there came to them a warner they would be better guided than any of the nations; but when there came to them a warner it increased them in naught but aversion.</AYA>
		<AYA id="035043">(In) behaving proudly in the land and in planning evil; and the evil plans shall not beset any save the authors of it. Then should they wait for aught except the way of the former people? For you shall not find any alteration in the course of Allah; and you shall not find any change in the course of Allah.</AYA>
		<AYA id="035044">Have they not travelled in the land and seen how was the end of those before them while they were stronger than these in power? And Allah is not such that any thing in the heavens or in the earth should escape Him; surely He is Knowing, Powerful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="035045">And were Allah to punish men for what they earn, He would not leave on the back of it any creature, but He respites them till an appointed term; so when their doom shall come, then surely Allah is Seeing with respect to His servants.</AYA>

		<AYA id="036023">What! shall I take besides Him gods whose intercession, If the Beneficent God should desire to afflict me with a harm, shall not avail me aught, nor shall they be able to deliver me?</AYA>
		<AYA id="036024">In that case I shall most surely be in clear error:</AYA>
		<AYA id="036025">Surely I believe in your Lord, therefore hear me.</AYA>
		<AYA id="036026">It was said: Enter the garden. He said: O would that my people had known</AYA>
		<AYA id="036027">Of that on account of which my Lord has forgiven me and made me of the honored ones!</AYA>
		<AYA id="036028">And We did not send down upon his people after him any hosts from heaven, nor do We ever send down.</AYA>
		<AYA id="036029">It was naught but a single cry, and lo! they were still.</AYA>
		<AYA id="036030">Alas for the servants! there comes not to them an apostle but they mock at him.</AYA>
		<AYA id="036031">Do they not consider how many of the generations have We destroyed before them, because they do not turn to them?</AYA>
		<AYA id="036032">And all of them shall surely be brought before Us.</AYA>
		<AYA id="036033">And a sign to them is the dead earth: We give life to it and bring forth from it grain SQ they eat of it.</AYA>
		<AYA id="036034">And We make therein gardens of palms and grapevines and We make springs to flow forth in it,</AYA>
		<AYA id="036035">That they may eat of the fruit thereof, and their hands did not make it; will they not then be grateful?</AYA>
		<AYA id="036036">Glory be to Him Who created pairs of all things, of what the earth grows, and of their kind and of what they do not know.</AYA>
		<AYA id="036037">And a sign to them is the night: We draw forth from it the day, then lo! they are in the dark;</AYA>
		<AYA id="036038">And the sun runs on to a term appointed for it; that is the ordinance of the Mighty, the Knowing.</AYA>
		<AYA id="036039">And (as for) the moon, We have ordained for it stages till it becomes again as an old dry palm branch.</AYA>
		<AYA id="036040">Neither is it allowable to the sun that it should overtake the moon, nor can the night outstrip the day; and all float on in a sphere.</AYA>
		<AYA id="036041">And a sign to them is that We bear their offspring in the laden ship.</AYA>
		<AYA id="036042">And We have created for them the like of it, what they will ride on.</AYA>
		<AYA id="036043">And if We please, We can drown them, then there shall be no succorer for them, nor shall they be rescued</AYA>
		<AYA id="036044">But (by) mercy from Us and for enjoyment till a time.</AYA>
		<AYA id="036045">And when it is said to them: Guard against what is before you and what is behind you, that mercy may be had on you.</AYA>
		<AYA id="036046">And there comes not to them a communication of the communications of their Lord but they turn aside from it.</AYA>
		<AYA id="036047">And when it is said to them: Spend out of what Allah has given you, those who disbelieve say to those who believe: Shall we feed him whom, if Allah please, He could feed? You are in naught but clear error.</AYA>
		<AYA id="036048">And they say: When will this threat come to pass, if you are truthful?</AYA>
		<AYA id="036049">They wait not for aught but a single cry which will overtake them while they yet contend with one another.</AYA>
		<AYA id="036050">So they shall not be able to make a bequest, nor shall they return to their families.</AYA>
		<AYA id="036051">And the trumpet shall be blown, when lo ! from their graves they shall hasten on to their Lord.</AYA>
		<AYA id="036052">They shall say: O woe to us! who has raised us up from our sleeping-place? This is what the Beneficent God promised and the apostles told the truth.</AYA>
		<AYA id="036053">There would be naught but a single cry, when lo ! they shall all be brought before Us;</AYA>
		<AYA id="036054">So this day no soul shall be dealt with unjustly in the least; and you shall not be rewarded aught but that which you did.</AYA>
		<AYA id="036055">Surely the dwellers of the garden shall on that day be in an occupation quite happy.</AYA>
		<AYA id="036056">They and their wives shall be in shades, reclining on raised couches.</AYA>
		<AYA id="036057">They shall have fruits therein, and they shall have whatever they desire</AYA>
		<AYA id="036058">Peace: a word from a Merciful Lord.</AYA>
		<AYA id="036059">And get aside today, O guilty ones!</AYA>
		<AYA id="036060">Did I not charge you, O children of Adam ! that you should not serve the Shaitan? Surely he is your open enemy,</AYA>
		<AYA id="036061">And that you should serve Me; this is the right way.</AYA>
		<AYA id="036062">And certainly he led astray numerous people from among you. What! could you not then understand?</AYA>
		<AYA id="036063">This is the hell with which you were threatened.</AYA>
		<AYA id="036064">Enter into it this day because you disbelieved.</AYA>
		<AYA id="036065">On that day We will set a seal upon their mouths, and their hands shall speak to Us, and their feet shall bear witness of what they earned.</AYA>
		<AYA id="036066">And if We please We would certainly put out their eyes, then they would run about groping for the way, but how should they see?</AYA>
		<AYA id="036067">And if We please We would surely transform them in their place, then they would not be able to go on, nor will they return.</AYA>
		<AYA id="036068">And whomsoever We cause to live long, We reduce (him) to an abject state in constitution; do they not then understand?</AYA>
		<AYA id="036069">And We have not taught him poetry, nor is it meet for him; it is nothing but a reminder and a plain Quran,</AYA>
		<AYA id="036070">That it may warn him who would have life, and (that) the word may prove true against the unbelievers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="036071">Do they not see that We have created cattle for them, out of what Our hands have wrought, so they are their masters?</AYA>
		<AYA id="036072">And We have subjected them to them, so some of them they have to ride upon, and some of them they eat.</AYA>
		<AYA id="036073">And therein they have advantages and drinks; will they not then be grateful?</AYA>
		<AYA id="036074">And they have taken gods besides Allah that they may be helped.</AYA>
		<AYA id="036075">(But) they shall not be able to assist them, and they shall be a host brought up before them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="036076">Therefore let not their speech grieve you; surely We know what they do in secret and what they do openly.</AYA>
		<AYA id="036077">Does not man see that We have created him from the small seed? Then lo! he is an open disputant.</AYA>
		<AYA id="036078">And he strikes out a likeness for Us and forgets his own creation. Says he: Who will give life to the bones when they are rotten?</AYA>
		<AYA id="036079">Say: He will give life to them Who brought them into existence at first, and He is cognizant of all creation</AYA>
		<AYA id="036080">He Who has made for you the fire (to burn) from the green tree, so that with it you kindle (fire).</AYA>
		<AYA id="036081">Is not He Who created the heavens and the earth able to create the like of them? Yea! and He is the Creator (of all), the Knower.</AYA>
		<AYA id="036082">His command, when He intends anything, is only to say to it: Be, so it is.</AYA>
		<AYA id="036083">Therefore glory be to Him in Whose hand is the kingdom of all things, and to Him you shall be brought back.</AYA>

		<AYA id="037087">What is then your idea about the Lord of the worlds?</AYA>

		<AYA id="037090">So they went away from him, turning back.</AYA>
		<AYA id="037091">Then he turned aside to their gods secretly and said: What! do you not eat?</AYA>
		<AYA id="037092">What is the matter with you that you do not speak?</AYA>
		<AYA id="037093">Then he turned against them secretly, smiting them with the right hand.</AYA>
		<AYA id="037094">So they (people) advanced towards him, hastening.</AYA>
		<AYA id="037095">Said he: What! do you worship what you hew out?</AYA>
		<AYA id="037096">And Allah has created you and what you make.</AYA>
		<AYA id="037097">They said: Build for him a furnace, then cast him into the burning fire.</AYA>
		<AYA id="037098">And they desired a war against him, but We brought them low.</AYA>
		<AYA id="037099">And he said: Surely I fly to my lord; He will guide me.</AYA>
		<AYA id="037100">My Lord! grant me of the doers of good deeds.</AYA>
		<AYA id="037101">So We gave him the good news of a boy, possessing forbearance.</AYA>
		<AYA id="037102">And when he attained to working with him, he said: O my son! surely I have seen in a dream that I should sacrifice you; consider then what you see. He said: O my father! do what you are commanded; if Allah please, you will find me of the patient ones.</AYA>
		<AYA id="037103">So when they both submitted and he threw him down upon his forehead,</AYA>
		<AYA id="037104">And We called out to him saying: O Ibrahim!</AYA>
		<AYA id="037105">You have indeed shown the truth of the vision; surely thus do We reward the doers of good:</AYA>
		<AYA id="037106">Most surely this is a manifest trial.</AYA>
		<AYA id="037107">And We ransomed him with a Feat sacrifice.</AYA>
		<AYA id="037108">And We perpetuated (praise) to him among the later generations</AYA>
		<AYA id="037109">Peace be on Ibrahim.</AYA>
		<AYA id="037110">Thus do We reward the doers of good.</AYA>
		<AYA id="037111">Surely he was one of Our believing servants.</AYA>
		<AYA id="037112">And We gave him the good news of Ishaq, a prophet among the good ones.</AYA>
		<AYA id="037113">And We showered Our blessings on him and on Ishaq; and of their offspring are the doers of good, and (also) those who are clearly unjust to their own souls.</AYA>
		<AYA id="037114">And certainly We conferred a favor on Musa and Haroun.</AYA>
		<AYA id="037115">And We delivered them both and their people from the mighty distress.</AYA>
		<AYA id="037116">And We helped them, so they were the vanquishers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="037117">And We gave them both the Book that made (things) clear.</AYA>
		<AYA id="037118">And We guided them both on the right way.</AYA>
		<AYA id="037119">And We perpetuated (praise) to them among the later generations.</AYA>
		<AYA id="037120">Peace be on Musa and Haroun.</AYA>
		<AYA id="037121">Even thus do We reward the doers of good.</AYA>
		<AYA id="037122">Surely they were both of Our believing servants.</AYA>
		<AYA id="037123">And Ilyas was most surely of the apostles.</AYA>
		<AYA id="037124">When he said to his people: Do you not guard (against evil)?</AYA>
		<AYA id="037125">What! do you call upon Ba'l and forsake the best of the creators,</AYA>
		<AYA id="037126">Allah, your Lord and the Lord of your fathers of yore?</AYA>
		<AYA id="037127">But they called him a liar, therefore they shall most surely be brought up.</AYA>
		<AYA id="037128">But not the servants of Allah, the purified ones.</AYA>
		<AYA id="037129">And We perpetuated to him (praise) among the later generations.</AYA>
		<AYA id="037130">Peace be on Ilyas.</AYA>
		<AYA id="037131">Even thus do We reward the doers of good.</AYA>
		<AYA id="037132">Surely he was one of Our believing servants.</AYA>
		<AYA id="037133">And Lut was most surely of the apostles.</AYA>
		<AYA id="037134">When We delivered him and his followers, all--</AYA>
		<AYA id="037135">Except an old woman (who was) amongst those who tarried.</AYA>
		<AYA id="037136">Then We destroyed the others.</AYA>
		<AYA id="037137">And most surely you pass by them in the morning,</AYA>
		<AYA id="037138">And at night; do you not then understand?</AYA>
		<AYA id="037139">And Yunus was most surely of the apostles.</AYA>
		<AYA id="037140">When he ran away to a ship completely laden,</AYA>
		<AYA id="037141">So he shared (with them), but was of those who are cast off.</AYA>
		<AYA id="037142">So the fish swallowed him while he did that for which he blamed himself</AYA>
		<AYA id="037143">But had it not been that he was of those who glorify (Us),</AYA>
		<AYA id="037144">He would certainly have tarried in its belly to the day when they are raised</AYA>
		<AYA id="037145">Then We cast him on to the vacant surface of the earth while he was sick.</AYA>
		<AYA id="037146">And We caused to grow up for him a gourdplant.</AYA>
		<AYA id="037147">And We sent him to a hundred thousand, rather they exceeded.</AYA>
		<AYA id="037148">And they believed, so We gave them provision till a time.</AYA>
		<AYA id="037149">Then ask them whether your Lord has daughters and they have sons.</AYA>
		<AYA id="037150">Or did We create the angels females while they were witnesses?</AYA>
		<AYA id="037151">Now surely it is of their own lie that they say:</AYA>
		<AYA id="037152">Allah has begotten; and most surely they are liars.</AYA>
		<AYA id="037153">Has He chosen daughters in preference to sons?</AYA>
		<AYA id="037154">What is the matter with you, how is it that you judge?</AYA>
		<AYA id="037155">Will you not then mind?</AYA>
		<AYA id="037156">Or have you a clear authority?</AYA>
		<AYA id="037157">Then bring your book, if you are truthful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="037158">And they assert a relationship between Him and the jinn; and certainly the jinn do know that they shall surely be brought up;</AYA>
		<AYA id="037159">Glory be to Allah (for freedom) from what they describe;</AYA>
		<AYA id="037160">But not so the servants of Allah, the purified ones.</AYA>
		<AYA id="037161">So surely you and what you worship,</AYA>
		<AYA id="037162">Not against Him can you cause (any) to fall into trial,</AYA>
		<AYA id="037163">Save him who will go to hell.</AYA>
		<AYA id="037164">And there is none of us but has an assigned place,</AYA>
		<AYA id="037165">And most surely we are they who draw themselves out in ranks,</AYA>
		<AYA id="037166">And we are most surely they who declare the glory (of Allah).</AYA>
		<AYA id="037167">And surely they used to say:</AYA>
		<AYA id="037168">Had we a reminder from those of yore,</AYA>
		<AYA id="037169">We would certainly have been the servants of Allah-- the purified ones.</AYA>
		<AYA id="037170">But (now) they disbelieve in it, so they will come to know.</AYA>
		<AYA id="037171">And certainly Our word has already gone forth in respect of Our servants, the apostles:</AYA>
		<AYA id="037172">Most surely they shall be the assisted ones</AYA>
		<AYA id="037173">And most surely Our host alone shall be the victorious ones.</AYA>
		<AYA id="037174">Therefore turn away from them till a time,</AYA>
		<AYA id="037175">And (then) see them, so they too shall see.</AYA>
		<AYA id="037176">What! would they then hasten on Our chastisement?</AYA>
		<AYA id="037177">But when it shall descend in their court, evil shall then be the morning of the warned ones.</AYA>

		<AYA id="038013">And Samood and the people of Lut and the dwellers of the thicket; these were the parties.</AYA>
		<AYA id="038014">There was none of them but called the apostles liars, so just was My retribution.</AYA>
		<AYA id="038015">Nor do these await aught but a single cry, there being no delay in it.</AYA>
		<AYA id="038016">And they say: O our Lord! hasten on to us our portion before the day of reckoning.</AYA>
		<AYA id="038017">Bear patiently what they say, and remember Our servant Dawood, the possessor of power; surely he was frequent m returning (to Allah).</AYA>
		<AYA id="038018">Surely We made the mountains to sing the glory (of Allah) in unison with him at the evening and the sunrise,</AYA>
		<AYA id="038019">And the birds gathered together; all joined in singing with him.</AYA>
		<AYA id="038020">And We strengthened his kingdom and We gave him wisdom and a clear judgment.</AYA>
		<AYA id="038021">And has there come to you the story of the litigants, when they made an entry into the private chamber by ascending over the walls?</AYA>
		<AYA id="038022">When they entered in upon Dawood and he was frightened at them, they said: Fear not; two litigants, of whom one has acted wrongfully towards the other, therefore decide between us with justice, and do not act unjustly, and guide us to the right way.</AYA>
		<AYA id="038023">Surely this is my brother; he has ninety-nine ewes and I have a single ewe; but he said: Make it over to me, and he has prevailed against me in discourse.</AYA>
		<AYA id="038024">He said: Surely he has been unjust to you in demanding your ewe (to add) to his own ewes; and most surely most of the partners act wrongfully towards one another, save those who believe and do good, and very few are they; and Dawood was sure that We had tried him, so he sought the protection of his Lord and he fell down bowing and turned time after time (to Him).</AYA>
		<AYA id="038025">Therefore We rectified for him this, and most surely he had a nearness to Us and an excellent resort.</AYA>
		<AYA id="038026">o Dawood ! surely We have made you a ruler in the land; so judge between men with justice and do not follow desire, lest it should lead you astray from the path of Allah; (as for) those who go astray from the path of Allah, they shall surely have a severe punishment because they forgot the day of reckoning.</AYA>
		<AYA id="038027">And We did not create the heaven and the earth and what is between them in vain; that is the opinion of those who disbelieve then woe to those who disbelieve on account of the fire.</AYA>
		<AYA id="038028">Shall We treat those who believe and do good like the mischief-makers in the earth? Or shall We make those who guard (against evil) like the wicked?</AYA>
		<AYA id="038029">(It is) a Book We have revealed to you abounding in good that they may ponder over its verses, and that those endowed with understanding may be mindful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="038030">And We gave to Dawood Sulaiman, most excellent the servant! Surely he was frequent in returning (to Allah).</AYA>
		<AYA id="038031">When there were brought to him in the evening (horses) still when standing, swift when running--</AYA>
		<AYA id="038032">Then he said: Surely I preferred the good things to the remembrance of my Lord-- until the sun set and time for Asr prayer was over, (he said):</AYA>
		<AYA id="038033">Bring them back to me; so he began to slash (their) legs and necks.</AYA>
		<AYA id="038034">And certainly We tried Sulaiman, and We put on his throne a (mere) body, so he turned (to Allah).</AYA>
		<AYA id="038035">He said: My Lord! do Thou forgive me and grant me a kingdom which is not fit for (being inherited by) anyone after me;</AYA>
		<AYA id="038036">Then We made the wind subservient to him; it made his command to run gently wherever he desired,</AYA>
		<AYA id="038037">And the shaitans, every builder and diver,</AYA>
		<AYA id="038038">And others fettered in chains.</AYA>
		<AYA id="038039">This is Our free gift, therefore give freely or withhold, without reckoning.</AYA>
		<AYA id="038040">And most surely he had a nearness to Us and an excellent resort.</AYA>
		<AYA id="038041">And remember Our servant Ayyub, when he called upon his Lord: The Shaitan has afflicted me with toil and torment.</AYA>
		<AYA id="038042">Urge with your foot; here is a cool washing-place and a drink.</AYA>
		<AYA id="038043">And We gave him his family and the like of them with them, as a mercy from Us, and as a reminder to those possessed of understanding.</AYA>
		<AYA id="038044">And take in your hand a green branch and beat her with It and do not break your oath; surely We found him patient; most excellent the servant! Surely he was frequent m returning (to Allah).</AYA>
		<AYA id="038045">And remember Our servants Ibrahim and Ishaq and Yaqoub, men of power and insight.</AYA>
		<AYA id="038046">Surely We purified them by a pure quality, the keeping m mind of the (final) abode.</AYA>
		<AYA id="038047">And most surely they were with Us, of the elect, the best.</AYA>
		<AYA id="038048">And remember Ismail and Al-Yasha and Zulkifl; and they were all of the best</AYA>
		<AYA id="038049">This is a reminder; and most surely there is an excellent resort for those who guard (against evil),</AYA>
		<AYA id="038050">The gardens of perpetuity, the doors are opened for them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="038051">Reclining therein, calling therein for many fruits and drink.</AYA>
		<AYA id="038052">And with them shall be those restraining their eyes, equals in age.</AYA>
		<AYA id="038053">This is what you are promised for the day of reckoning.</AYA>
		<AYA id="038054">Most surely this is Our sustenance; it shall never come to an end;</AYA>
		<AYA id="038055">This (shall be so); and most surely there is an evil resort for the inordinate ones;</AYA>
		<AYA id="038056">Hell; they shall enter it, so evil is the resting-place.</AYA>
		<AYA id="038057">This (shall be so); so let them taste it, boiling and intensely cold (drink).</AYA>
		<AYA id="038058">And other (punishment) of the same kind-- of various sorts.</AYA>
		<AYA id="038059">This is an army plunging in without consideration along with you; no welcome for them, surely they shall enter fire.</AYA>
		<AYA id="038060">They shall say: Nay! you-- no welcome to you: you did proffer it to us, so evil is the resting-place.</AYA>
		<AYA id="038061">They shall say: Our Lord! whoever prepared it first for us, add Thou to him a double chastisement in the fire.</AYA>
		<AYA id="038062">And they shall say: What is the matter with us that we do not see men 
whom we used to count among the vicious?</AYA>
		<AYA id="038063">Was it that we (only) took them in scorn, or have our eyes (now) turned aside from them?</AYA>
		<AYA id="038064">That most surely is the truth: the contending one with another of the inmates of the fire.</AYA>
		<AYA id="038065">Say: I am only a warner, and there is no god but Allah, the One, the Subduer (of all):</AYA>
		<AYA id="038066">The Lord of the heavens and the earth and what is between them, the Mighty, the most Forgiving.</AYA>
		<AYA id="038067">Say: It is a message of importance,</AYA>

		<AYA id="038071">When your Lord said to the angels; Surely I am going to create a mortal from dust:</AYA>
		<AYA id="038072">So when I have made him complete and breathed into him of My spirit, then fall down making obeisance to him.</AYA>
		<AYA id="038073">And the angels did obeisance, all of them,</AYA>
		<AYA id="038074">But not Iblis: he was proud and he was one of the unbelievers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="038075">He said: O Iblis! what prevented you that you should do obeisance to him whom I created with My two hands? Are you proud or are you of the exalted ones?</AYA>
		<AYA id="038076">He said: I am better than he; Thou hast created me of fire, and him Thou didst create of dust.</AYA>
		<AYA id="038077">He said: Then get out of it, for surely you are driven away:</AYA>
		<AYA id="038078">And surely My curse is on you to the day of judgment.</AYA>
		<AYA id="038079">He said: My Lord! then respite me to the day that they are raised.</AYA>

		<AYA id="039001">The revelation of the Book is from Allah, the Mighty, the Wise.</AYA>
		<AYA id="039002">Surely We have revealed to you the Book with the truth, therefore serve Allah, being sincere to Him in obedience.</AYA>
		<AYA id="039003">Now, surely, sincere obedience is due to Allah (alone) and (as for) those who take guardians besides Him, (saying), We do not serve them save that they may make us nearer to Allah, surely Allah will judge between them in that in which they differ; surely Allah does not guide him aright who is a liar, ungrateful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="039004">If Allah desire to take a son to Himself, He will surely choose those He pleases from what He has created. Glory be to Him: He is Allah, the One, the Subduer (of all).</AYA>
		<AYA id="039005">He has created the heavens and the earth with the truth; He makes the night cover the day and makes the day overtake the night, and He has made the sun and the moon subservient; each one runs on to an assigned term; now surely He is the Mighty, the great Forgiver.</AYA>
		<AYA id="039006">He has created you from a single being, then made its mate of the same (kind), and He has made for you eight of the cattle in pairs. He creates you in the wombs of your mothers-- a creation after a creation-- in triple darkness; that is Allah your Lord, His is the kingdom; there is no god but He; whence are you then turned away?</AYA>
		<AYA id="039007">If you are ungrateful, then surely Allah is Self-sufficient above all need of you; and He does not like ungratefulness in His servants; and if you are grateful, He likes it in you; and no bearer of burden shall bear the burden of another; then to your Lord is your return, then will He inform you of what you did; surely He is Cognizant of what is in the breasts.</AYA>
		<AYA id="039008">And when distress afflicts a man he calls upon his Lord turning to Him frequently; then when He makes him possess a favor from Him, he forgets that for which he called upon Him before, and sets up rivals to Allah that he may cause (men) to stray off from His path. Say: Enjoy yourself in your ungratefulness a little, surely you are of the inmates of the fire.</AYA>
		<AYA id="039009">What! he who is obedient during hours of the night, prostrating himself and standing, takes care of the hereafter and hopes for the mercy of his Lord! Say: Are those who know and those who do not know alike? Only the men of understanding are mindful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="039010">Say: O my servants who believe! be careful of (your duty to) your Lord; for those who do good in this world is good, and Allah's earth is spacious; only the patient will be paid back their reward in full without measure.</AYA>
		<AYA id="039011">Say: I am commanded that I should serve Allah, being sincere to Him in obedience.</AYA>
		<AYA id="039012">And I am commanded that I shall be the first of those who submit.</AYA>
		<AYA id="039013">Say: I fear, if I disobey my Lord, the chastisement of a grievous day.</AYA>
		<AYA id="039014">Say: Allah (it is Whom) I serve, being sincere to Him in my obedience:</AYA>
		<AYA id="039015">Serve then what you like besides Him. Say: The losers surely are those who shall have lost themselves and their families on the day of resurrection; now surely that is the clear loss.</AYA>
		<AYA id="039016">They shall have coverings of fire above them and coverings beneath them; with that Allah makes His servants to fear, so be careful of (your duty to) Me, O My servants!</AYA>
		<AYA id="039017">And (as for) those who keep off from the worship of the idols and turn to Allah, they shall have good news, therefore give good news to My servants,</AYA>
		<AYA id="039018">Those who listen to the word, then follow the best of it; those are they whom Allah has guided, and those it is who are the men of understanding.</AYA>
		<AYA id="039019">What! as for him then against whom the sentence of chastisement is due: What! can you save him who is in the fire?</AYA>
		<AYA id="039020">But (as for) those who are careful of (their duty to) their Lord, they shall have high places, above them higher places, built (for them), beneath which flow rivers; (this is) the promise of Allah: Allah will not fail in (His) promise.</AYA>
		<AYA id="039021">Do you not see that Allah sends down water from the cloud, then makes it go along in the earth in springs, then brings forth therewith herbage of various colors, then it withers so that you see it becoming yellow, then He makes it a thing crushed and broken into pieces? Most surely there is a reminder in this for the men of understanding.</AYA>
		<AYA id="039022">What! is he whose heart Allah has opened for Islam so that he is in a light from his Lord (like the hard-hearted)? Nay, woe to those whose hearts are hard against the remembrance of Allah; those are in clear error.</AYA>
		<AYA id="039023">Allah has revealed the best announcement, a book conformable in its various parts, repeating, whereat do shudder the skins of those who fear their Lord, then their skins and their hearts become pliant to the remembrance of Allah; this is Allah's guidance, He guides with it whom He pleases; and (as for) him whom Allah makes err, there is no guide for him.</AYA>
		<AYA id="039024">Is he then who has to guard himself with his own person against the evil chastisement on the resurrection day? And it will be said to the unjust: Taste what you earned.</AYA>
		<AYA id="039025">Those before them rejected (prophets), therefore there came to them the chastisement from whence they perceived not.</AYA>
		<AYA id="039026">So Allah made them taste the disgrace in this world's life, and certainly the punishment of the hereafter is greater; did they but know!</AYA>
		<AYA id="039027">And certainly We have set forth to men in this Quran similitudes of every sort that they may mind.</AYA>
		<AYA id="039028">An Arabic Quran without any crookedness, that they may guard (against evil).</AYA>
		<AYA id="039029">Allah sets forth an example: There is a slave in whom are (several) partners differing with one another, and there is another slave wholly owned by one man. Are the two alike in condition? (All) praise is due to Allah. Nay! most of them do not know.</AYA>
		<AYA id="039030">Surely you shall die and they (too) shall surely die.</AYA>
		<AYA id="039031">Then surely on the day of resurrection you will contend one with another before. your Lord.</AYA>
		<AYA id="039032">Who is then more unjust than he who utters a lie against Allah and (he who) gives the lie to the truth when it comes to him; is there not in hell an abode for the unbelievers?</AYA>
		<AYA id="039033">And he who brings the truth and (he who) accepts it as the truth-- these are they that guard (against evil).</AYA>
		<AYA id="039034">They shall have with their Lord what they please; that is the reward of the doers of good;</AYA>
		<AYA id="039035">So that Allah will do away with the worst of what they did and give them their reward for the best of what they do.</AYA>
		<AYA id="039036">Is not Allah sufficient for His servant? And they seek to frighten you with those besides Him; and whomsoever Allah makes err, there is no guide for him.</AYA>
		<AYA id="039037">And whom Allah guides, there is none that can lead him astray; is not Allah Mighty, the Lord of retribution?</AYA>
		<AYA id="039038">And should you ask them, Who created the heavens and the earth? They would most certainly say: Allah. Say: Have you then considered that what you call upon besides Allah, would they, if Allah desire to afflict me with harm, be the removers of His harm, or (would they), if Allah desire to show me mercy, be the withholders of His mercy? Say: Allah is sufficient for me; on Him do the reliant rely.</AYA>
		<AYA id="039039">Say: O my people! work in your place, surely I am a worker, so you will come to know.</AYA>
		<AYA id="039040">Who it is to whom there shall come a punishment which will disgrace him and to whom will be due a lasting punishment.</AYA>
		<AYA id="039041">Surely We have revealed to you the Book with the truth for the sake of men; so whoever follows the right way, it is for his own soul and whoever errs, he errs only to its detriment; and you are not a custodian over them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="039042">Allah takes the souls at the time of their death, and those that die not during their sleep; then He withholds those on whom He has passed the decree of death and sends the others back till an appointed term; most surely there are signs in this for a people who reflect.</AYA>
		<AYA id="039043">Or have they taken intercessors besides Allah? Say: what! even though they did not ever have control over anything, nor do they understand.</AYA>
		<AYA id="039044">Say: Allah's is the intercession altogether; His is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, then to Him you shall be brought back.</AYA>
		<AYA id="039045">And when Allah alone is mentioned, the hearts of those who do not believe in the hereafter shrink, and when those besides Him are mentioned, lo! they are joyful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="039046">Say: O Allah! Originator of the heavens and the earth, Knower of the unseen and the seen! Thou (only) judgest between Thy servants as to that wherein they differ.</AYA>
		<AYA id="039047">And had those who are unjust all that is in the earth and the like of it with it, they would certainly offer it as ransom (to be saved) from the evil of the punishment on the day of resurrection; and what they never thought of shall become plain to them from Allah.</AYA>
		<AYA id="039048">And the evil (consequences) of what they wrought shall become plain to them, and the very thing they mocked at shall beset them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="039049">So when harm afflicts a man he calls upon Us; then, when We give him a favor from Us, he says: I have been given it only by means of knowledge. Nay, it is a trial, but most of them do not know.</AYA>
		<AYA id="039050">Those before them did say it indeed, but what they earned availed them not.</AYA>
		<AYA id="039051">So there befell them the evil (consequences) of what they earned; and (as for) those who are unjust from among these, there shall befall them the evil (consequences) of what they earn, and they shall not escape.</AYA>
		<AYA id="039052">Do they not know that Allah makes ample the means of subsistence to whom He pleases, and He straitens; most surely there are signs in this for a people who believe.</AYA>
		<AYA id="039053">Say: O my servants! who have acted extravagantly against their own souls, do not despair of the mercy of Allah; surely Allah forgives the faults altogether; surely He is the Forgiving the Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="039054">And return to your Lord time after time and submit to Him before there comes to you the punishment, then you shall not be helped.</AYA>
		<AYA id="039055">And follow the best that has been revealed to you from your Lord before there comes to you the punishment all of a sudden while you do not even perceive;</AYA>
		<AYA id="039056">Lest a soul should say: O woe to me! for what I fell short of my duty to Allah, and most surely I was of those who laughed to scorn;</AYA>
		<AYA id="039057">Or it should say: Had Allah guided me, I would certainly have been of those who guard (against evil);</AYA>
		<AYA id="039058">Or it should say when it sees the punishment: Were there only a returning for me, I should be of the doers of good.</AYA>
		<AYA id="039059">Aye! My communications came to you, but you rejected them, and you were proud and you were one of the unbelievers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="039060">And on the day of resurrection you shall see those who lied against Allah; their faces shall be blackened. Is there not in hell an abode for the proud?</AYA>
		<AYA id="039061">And Allah shall deliver those who guard (against evil) with their achievement; evil shall not touch them, nor shall they grieve.</AYA>
		<AYA id="039062">Allah is the Creator of every thing and He has charge over every thing.</AYA>
		<AYA id="039063">His are the treasures of the heavens and the earth; and (as for) those who disbelieve in the communications of Allah, these it is that are the losers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="039064">Say: What! Do you then bid me serve others than Allah, O ignorant men?</AYA>
		<AYA id="039065">And certainly, it has been revealed to you and to those before you: Surely if you associate (with Allah), your work would certainly come to naught and you would certainly be of the losers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="039066">Nay! but serve Allah alone and be of the thankful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="039067">And they have not honored Allah with the honor that is due to Him; and the whole earth shall be in His grip on the day of resurrection and the heavens rolled up in His right hand; glory be to Him, and may He be exalted above what they associate (with Him).</AYA>
		<AYA id="039068">And the trumpet shall be blown, so all those that are in the heavens and all those that are in the earth shall swoon, except such as Allah please; then it shall be blown again, then lo! they shall stand up awaiting.</AYA>
		<AYA id="039069">And the earth shall beam with the light of its Lord, and the Book shall be laid down, and the prophets and the witnesses shall be brought up, and judgment shall be given between them with justice, and they shall not be dealt with unjustly.</AYA>
		<AYA id="039070">And every soul shall be paid back fully what it has done, and He knows best what they do.</AYA>
		<AYA id="039071">And those who disbelieve shall be driven to hell in companies; until, when they come to it, its doors shall be opened, and the keepers of it shall say to them: Did not there come to you apostles from among you reciting to you the communications of your Lord and warning you of the meeting of this day of yours? They shall say: Yea! But the sentence of punishment was due against the unbelievers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="039072">It shall be said: Enter the gates of hell to abide therein; so evil is the abode of the proud.</AYA>
		<AYA id="039073">And those who are careful of (their duty to) their Lord shall be conveyed to the garden in companies; until when they come to it, and its doors shall be opened, and the keepers of it shall say to them: Peace be on you, you shall be happy; therefore enter it to abide.</AYA>
		<AYA id="039074">And they shall say: (All) praise is due to Allah, Who has made good to us His promise, and He has made us inherit the land; we may abide in the garden where we please; so goodly is the reward of the workers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="039075">And you shall see the angels going round about the throne glorifying the praise of their Lord; and judgment shall be given between them with justice, and it shall be said: All praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the worlds.</AYA>

		<AYA id="040002">The revelation of the Book is from Allah, the Mighty, the Knowing,</AYA>
		<AYA id="040003">The Forgiver of the faults and the Acceptor of repentance, Severe to punish, Lord of bounty; there is no god but He; to Him is the eventual coming.</AYA>
		<AYA id="040004">None dispute concerning the communications of Allah but those who disbelieve, therefore let not their going to and fro in the cities deceive you.</AYA>
		<AYA id="040005">The people of Nuh and the parties after them rejected (prophets) before them, and every nation purposed against their apostle to destroy him, and they disputed by means of the falsehood that they might thereby render null the truth, therefore I destroyed them; how was then My retribution!</AYA>
		<AYA id="040006">And thus did the word of your Lord prove true against those who disbelieved that they are the inmates of the fire.</AYA>
		<AYA id="040007">Those who bear the power and those around Him celebrate the praise of their Lord and believe in Him and ask protection for those who believe: Our Lord! Thou embracest all things in mercy and knowledge, therefore grant protection to those who turn (to Thee) and follow Thy way, and save them from the punishment of the hell:</AYA>
		<AYA id="040008">Our Lord! and make them enter the gardens of perpetuity which Thou hast promised to them and those who do good of their fathers and their wives and their offspring, surely Thou are the Mighty, the Wise.</AYA>
		<AYA id="040009">And keep them from evil deeds, and whom Thou keepest from evil deeds this day, indeed Thou hast mercy on him, and that is the mighty achievement.</AYA>
		<AYA id="040010">Surely those who disbelieve shall be cried out to: Certainly Allah's hatred (of you) when you were called upon to the faith and you rejected, is much greater than your hatred of yourselves.</AYA>
		<AYA id="040011">They shall say: Our Lord! twice didst Thou make us subject to death, and twice hast Thou given us life, so we do confess our faults; is there then a way to get out?</AYA>
		<AYA id="040012">That is because when Allah alone was called upon, you disbelieved, and when associates were given to Him, you believed; so judgment belongs to Allah, the High, the Great.</AYA>
		<AYA id="040013">He it is Who shows you His signs and sends down for you sustenance from heaven, and none minds but he who turns (to Him) again and again.</AYA>

		<AYA id="040018">And warn them of the day that draws near, when hearts shall rise up to the throats, grieving inwardly; the unjust shall not have any compassionate friend nor any intercessor who should be obeyed.</AYA>
		<AYA id="040019">He knows the stealthy looks and that which the breasts conceal.</AYA>
		<AYA id="040020">And Allah judges with the truth; and those whom they call upon besides Him cannot judge aught; surely Allah is the Hearing, the Seeing.</AYA>
		<AYA id="040021">Have they not travelled in the earth and seen how was the end of those who were before them? Mightier than these were they in strength-- and in fortifications in the land, but Allah destroyed them for their sins; and there was not for them any defender against Allah.</AYA>
		<AYA id="040022">That was because there came to them their apostles with clear arguments, but they rejected (them), therefore Allah destroyed them; surely He is Strong, Severe in retribution.</AYA>
		<AYA id="040023">And certainly We sent Musa with Our communications and clear authority,</AYA>
		<AYA id="040024">To Firon and Haman and Qaroun, but they said: A lying magician.</AYA>
		<AYA id="040025">So when he brought to them the truth from Us, they said: Slay the sons of those who believe with him and keep their women alive; and the struggle of the unbelievers will only come to a state of perdition.</AYA>
		<AYA id="040026">And Firon said: Let me alone that I may slay Musa and let him call upon his Lord; surely I fear that he will change your religion or that he will make mischief to appear in the land.</AYA>
		<AYA id="040027">And Musa said: Surely I take refuge with my Lord and-- your Lord from every proud one who does not believe in the day of reckoning.</AYA>
		<AYA id="040028">And a believing man of Firon's people who hid his faith said: What! will you slay a man because he says: My Lord is Allah, and indeed he has brought to you clear arguments from your Lord? And if he be a liar, on him will be his lie, and if he be truthful, there will befall you some of that which he threatens you (with); surely Allah does not guide him who is extravagant, a liar:</AYA>
		<AYA id="040029">O my people! yours is the kingdom this day, being masters in the land, but who will help us against the punishment of Allah if it come to us? Firon said: I do not show you aught but that which I see (myself), and I do not make you follow any but the right way.</AYA>
		<AYA id="040030">And he who believed said: O my people! surely I fear for you the like of what befell the parties:</AYA>
		<AYA id="040031">The like of what befell the people of Nuh and Ad and Samood and those after them, and Allah does not desire injustice for (His) servants;</AYA>
		<AYA id="040032">And, O my people! I fear for you the day of calling out,</AYA>
		<AYA id="040033">The day on which you will turn back retreating; there shall be no savior for you from Allah, and whomsoever Allah causes to err, there is no guide for him:</AYA>
		<AYA id="040034">And certainly Yusuf came to you before with clear arguments, but you ever remained in doubt as to what he brought; until when he died, you said: Allah will never raise an apostle after him. Thus does Allah cause him to err who is extravagant, a doubter</AYA>
		<AYA id="040035">Those who dispute concerning the communications of Allah without any authority that He has given them; greatly hated is it by Allah and by-those who believe. Thus does Allah set a seal over the heart of every proud, haughty one.</AYA>
		<AYA id="040036">And Firon said: O Haman! build for me a tower that I may attain the means of access,</AYA>
		<AYA id="040037">The means of access to the heavens, then reach the God of Musa, and I surely think him to be a liar. And thus the evil of his deed was made fairseeming to Firon, and he was turned away from the way; and the struggle of Firon was not (to end) in aught but destruction.</AYA>
		<AYA id="040038">And he who believed said: O my people! follow me, I will guide you to the right course;</AYA>
		<AYA id="040039">O my people! this life of the world is only a (passing) enjoyment, and surely the hereafter is the abode to settle;</AYA>
		<AYA id="040040">Whoever does an evil, he shall not be recompensed (with aught) but the like of it, and whoever does good, whether male or female, and he is a believer, these shall enter the garden, in which they shall be given sustenance without measure.</AYA>
		<AYA id="040041">And, O my people! how is it that I call you to salvation and you call me to the fire?</AYA>
		<AYA id="040042">You call on me that I should disbelieve in Allah and associate with Him that of which I have no knowledge, and I call you to the Mighty, the most Forgiving;</AYA>
		<AYA id="040043">No doubt that what you call me to has no title to be called to in this world, nor in the hereafter, and that our turning back is to Allah, and that the extravagant are the inmates of the fire;</AYA>
		<AYA id="040044">So you shall remember what I say to you, and I entrust my affair to Allah, Surely Allah sees the servants.</AYA>
		<AYA id="040045">So Allah protected him from the evil (consequences) of what they planned, and the most evil punishment overtook Firon's people:</AYA>
		<AYA id="040046">The fire; they shall be brought before it (every) morning and evening and on the day when the hour shall come to pass: Make Firon's people enter the severest chastisement.</AYA>
		<AYA id="040047">And when they shall contend one with another in the fire, then the weak shall say to those who were proud: Surely we were your followers; will you then avert from us a portion of the fire?</AYA>
		<AYA id="040048">Those who were proud shall say: Surely we are all in it: surely Allah has judged between the servants.</AYA>
		<AYA id="040049">And those who are in the fire shall say to the keepers of hell: Call upon your Lord that He may lighten to us one day of the punishment.</AYA>
		<AYA id="040050">They shall say: Did not your apostles come to you with clear arguments? They shall say: Yea. They shall say: Then call. And the call of the unbelievers is only in error.</AYA>
		<AYA id="040051">Most surely We help Our apostles, and those who believe, in this world's life and on the day when the witnesses shall stand</AYA>
		<AYA id="040052">The day on which their excuse shall not benefit the unjust, and for them is curse and for them is the evil abode.</AYA>
		<AYA id="040053">And certainly We gave Musa the guidance, and We made the children of Israel inherit the Book,</AYA>
		<AYA id="040054">A guidance and a reminder to the men of understanding.</AYA>
		<AYA id="040055">Therefore be patient; surely the promise of Allah is true; and ask protection for your fault and sing the praise of your Lord in the evening and the morning.</AYA>
		<AYA id="040056">Surely (as for) those who dispute about the communications of Allah without any authority that has come to them, there is naught in their breasts but (a desire) to become great which they shall never attain to; Therefore seek refuge in Allah, surely He is the Hearing, the Seeing.</AYA>
		<AYA id="040057">Certainly the creation of the heavens and the earth is greater than the creation of the men, but most people do not know</AYA>
		<AYA id="040058">And the blind and the seeing are not alike, nor those who believe and do good and the evil-doer; little is it that you are mindful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="040059">Most surely the hour is coming, there is no doubt therein, but most people do not believe.</AYA>
		<AYA id="040060">And your Lord says: Call upon Me, I will answer you; surely those who are too proud for My service shall soon enter hell abased.</AYA>
		<AYA id="040061">Allah is He Who made for you the night that you may rest therein and the day to see; most surely Allah is Gracious to men, but most men do not give thanks.</AYA>
		<AYA id="040062">That is Allah, your Lord, the Creator of everything; there is no God but He; whence are you then turned away?</AYA>
		<AYA id="040063">Thus were turned away those who denied the communications of Allah.</AYA>
		<AYA id="040064">Allah is He Who made the earth a resting-place for you and the heaven a canopy, and He formed you, then made goodly your forms, and He provided you with goodly things; that is Allah, your Lord; blessed then is Allah, the Lord of the worlds.</AYA>
		<AYA id="040065">He is the Living, there is no god but He, therefore call on Him, being sincere to Him in obedience; (all) praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the worlds.</AYA>
		<AYA id="040066">Say: I am forbidden to serve those whom you call upon besides Allah when clear arguments have come to me from my Lord, and I am commanded that I should submit to the Lord of the worlds.</AYA>
		<AYA id="040067">He it is Who created you from dust, then from a small lifegerm, then from a clot, then He brings you forth as a child, then that you may attain your maturity, then that you may be old-- and of you there are some who are caused to die before-- and that you may reach an appointed term, and that you may understand.</AYA>
		<AYA id="040068">He it is Who gives life and brings death, so when He decrees an affair, He only says to it: Be, and it is.</AYA>
		<AYA id="040069">Have you not seen those who dispute with respect to the communications of Allah: how are they turned away?</AYA>
		<AYA id="040070">Those who reject the Book and that with which We have sent Our Apostle; but they shall soon come to know,</AYA>
		<AYA id="040071">When the fetters and the chains shall be on their necks; they shall be dragged</AYA>
		<AYA id="040072">Into boiling water, then in the fire shall they be burned;</AYA>
		<AYA id="040073">Then shall it be said to them: Where is that which you used to set up</AYA>
		<AYA id="040074">Besides Allah? They shall say: They are gone away from us, nay, we used not to call upon anything before. Thus does Allah confound the unbelievers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="040075">That is because you exulted in the land unjustly and because you behaved insolently.</AYA>
		<AYA id="040076">Enter the gates of hell to abide therein, evil then is the abode of the proud.</AYA>
		<AYA id="040077">So be patient, surely the promise of Allah is true. So should We make you see part of what We threaten them with, or should We cause you to die, to Us shall they be returned.</AYA>
		<AYA id="040078">And certainly We sent apostles before you: there are some of them that We have mentioned to you and there are others whom We have not mentioned to you, and it was not meet for an apostle that he should bring a sign except with Allah's permission, but when the command of Allah came, judgment was given with truth, and those who treated (it) as a lie were lost.</AYA>
		<AYA id="040079">Allah is He Who made the cattle for you that you may ride on some of them, and some of them you eat.</AYA>
		<AYA id="040080">And there are advantages for you in them, and that you may attain thereon a want which is in your breasts, and upon them and upon the ships you are borne.</AYA>
		<AYA id="040081">And He shows you His signs: which then of Allah's signs will you deny?</AYA>
		<AYA id="040082">Have they not then journeyed in the land and seen how was the end of those before them? They were more (in numbers) than these and greater in strength and in fortifications in the land, but what they earned did not avail them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="040083">Then when their apostles came to them with clear arguments, they exulted in what they had with them of knowledge, and there beset them that which they used to mock.</AYA>
		<AYA id="040084">But when they saw Our punishment, they said: We believe in Allah alone and we deny what we used to associate with Him.</AYA>
		<AYA id="040085">But their belief was not going to profit them when they had seen Our punishment; (this is) Allah's law, which has indeed obtained in the matter of His servants, and there the unbelievers are lost.</AYA>

	<SOURA id="41" name="Ha Mim">
		<AYA id="041001">Ha Mim!</AYA>
		<AYA id="041002">A revelation from the Beneficent, the Merciful God:</AYA>
		<AYA id="041003">A Book of which the verses are made plain, an Arabic Quran for a people who know:</AYA>
		<AYA id="041004">A herald of good news and a warner, but most of them turn aside so they hear not.</AYA>
		<AYA id="041005">And they say: Our hearts are under coverings from that to which you call us, and there is a heaviness in our ears, and a veil hangs between us and you, so work, we too are working.</AYA>
		<AYA id="041006">Say: I am only a mortal like you; it is revealed to me that your God is one God, therefore follow the right way to Him and ask His forgiveness; and woe to the polytheists;</AYA>
		<AYA id="041007">(To) those who do not give poor-rate and they are unbelievers in the hereafter.</AYA>
		<AYA id="041008">(As for) those who believe and do good, they shall surely have a reward never to be cut off.</AYA>
		<AYA id="041009">Say: What! do you indeed disbelieve in Him Who created the earth in two periods, and do you set up equals with Him? That is the Lord of the Worlds.</AYA>
		<AYA id="041010">And He made in it mountains above its surface, and He blessed therein and made therein its foods, in four periods: alike for the seekers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="041011">Then He directed Himself to the heaven and it is a vapor, so He said to it and to the earth: Come both, willingly or unwillingly. They both said: We come willingly.</AYA>
		<AYA id="041012">So He ordained them seven heavens in two periods, and revealed in every heaven its affair; and We adorned the lower heaven with brilliant stars and (made it) to guard; that is the decree of the Mighty, the Knowing.</AYA>
		<AYA id="041013">But if they turn aside, then say: I have warned you of a scourge like the scourge of Ad and Samood.</AYA>
		<AYA id="041014">When their apostles came to them from before them and from behind them, saying, Serve nothing but Allah, they said: If our Lord had pleased He would certainly have sent down angels, so we are surely unbelievers in that with which you are sent.</AYA>
		<AYA id="041015">Then as to Ad, they were unjustly proud in the land, and they said: Who is mightier in strength than we? Did they not see that Allah Who created them was mightier than they in strength, and they denied Our communications?</AYA>
		<AYA id="041016">So We sent on them a furious wind in unlucky days, that We may make them taste the chastisement of abasement in this world's life; and certainly the chastisement of the hereafter is much more abasing, and they shall not be helped.</AYA>
		<AYA id="041017">And as to Samood, We showed them the right way, but they chose error above guidance, so there overtook them the scourge of an abasing chastisement for what they earned.</AYA>
		<AYA id="041018">And We delivered those who believed and guarded (against evil).</AYA>
		<AYA id="041019">And on the day that the enemies of Allah shall be brought together to the fire, then they shall be formed into groups.</AYA>
		<AYA id="041020">Until when they come to it, their ears and their eyes and their skins shall bear witness against them as to what they did.</AYA>
		<AYA id="041021">And they shall say to their skins: Why have you borne witness against us? They shall say: Allah Who makes everything speak has made us speak, and He created you at first, and to Him you shall be brought back.</AYA>
		<AYA id="041022">And you did not veil yourselves lest your ears and your eyes and your skins should bear witness against you, but you thought that Allah did not know most of what you did.</AYA>
		<AYA id="041023">And that was your (evil) thought which you entertained about your Lord that has tumbled you down into perdition, so are you become of the lost ones.</AYA>
		<AYA id="041024">Then if they will endure, still the fire is their abode, and if they ask for goodwill, then are they not of those who shall be granted goodwill.</AYA>
		<AYA id="041025">And We have appointed for them comrades so they have made fair-seeming to them what is before them and what is behind them, and the word proved true against them-- among the nations of the jinn and the men that have passed away before them-- that they shall surely be losers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="041026">And those who disbelieve say: Do not listen to this Quran and make noise therein, perhaps you may overcome.</AYA>
		<AYA id="041027">Therefore We will most certainly make those who disbelieve taste a severe punishment, and We will most certainly reward them for the evil deeds they used to do.</AYA>
		<AYA id="041028">That is the reward of the enemies of Allah-- the fire; for them therein shall be the house of long abiding; a reward for their denying Our communications.</AYA>
		<AYA id="041029">And those who disbelieve will say: Our Lord! show us those who led us astray from among the jinn and the men that we may trample them under our feet so that they may be of the lowest.</AYA>
		<AYA id="041030">(As for) those who say: Our Lord is Allah, then continue in the right way, the angels descend upon them, saying: Fear not, nor be grieved, and receive good news of the garden which you were promised.</AYA>
		<AYA id="041031">We are your guardians in this world's life and in the hereafter, and you shall have therein what your souls desire and you shall have therein what you ask for:</AYA>
		<AYA id="041032">A provision from the Forgiving, the Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="041033">And who speaks better than he who calls to Allah while he himself does good, and says: I am surely of those who submit?</AYA>
		<AYA id="041034">And not alike are the good and the evil. Repel (evil) with what is best, when lo! he between whom and you was enmity would be as if he were a warm friend.</AYA>
		<AYA id="041035">And none are made to receive it but those who are patient, and none are made to receive it but those who have a mighty good fortune.</AYA>
		<AYA id="041036">And if an interference of the Shaitan should cause you mischief, seek refuge in Allah; surely He is the Hearing, the Knowing.</AYA>
		<AYA id="041037">And among His signs are the night and the day and the sun and the moon; do not make obeisance to the sun nor to the moon; and make obeisance to Allah Who created them, if Him it is that you serve.</AYA>
		<AYA id="041038">But if they are proud, yet those with your Lord glorify Him during the night and the day, and they are not tired.</AYA>
		<AYA id="041039">And among His signs is this, that you see the earth still, but when We send down on it the water, it stirs and swells: most surely He Who gives it life is the Giver of life to the dead; surely He has power over all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="041040">Surely they who deviate from the right way concerning Our communications are not hidden from Us. What! is he then who is cast into the fire better, or he who comes safe on the day of resurrection? Do what you like, surely He sees what you do.</AYA>
		<AYA id="041041">Surely those who disbelieve in the reminder when it comes to them, and most surely it is a Mighty Book:</AYA>
		<AYA id="041042">Falsehood shall not come to it from before it nor from behind it; a revelation from the Wise, the Praised One.</AYA>
		<AYA id="041043">Naught is said to you but what was said indeed to the apostles before you; surely your Lord is the Lord of forgiveness and the Lord of painful retribution</AYA>
		<AYA id="041044">And if We had made it a Quran in a foreign tongue, they would certainly have said: Why have not its communications been made clear? What! a foreign (tongue) and an Arabian! Say: It is to those who believe a guidance and a healing; and (as for) those who do not believe, there is a heaviness in their ears and it is obscure to them; these shall be called to from a far-off place.</AYA>
		<AYA id="041045">And certainly We gave the Book to Musa, but it has been differed about, and had not a word already gone forth from your Lord, judgment would certainly have been given between them; and most surely they are in a disquieting doubt about it.</AYA>
		<AYA id="041046">Whoever does good, it is for his own soul, and whoever does evil, it is against it; and your Lord is not in the least unjust to the servants.</AYA>
		<AYA id="041047">To Him is referred the knowledge of the hour, and there come not forth any of the fruits from their coverings, nor does a female bear, nor does she give birth, but with His knowledge; and on the day when He shall call out to them, Where are (those whom you called) My associates? They shall say: We declare to Thee, none of us is a witness.</AYA>
		<AYA id="041048">And away from them shall go what they called upon before, and they shall know for certain that there is no escape for them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="041049">Man is never tired of praying for good, and if evil touch him, then he is despairing, hopeless.</AYA>
		<AYA id="041050">And if We make him taste mercy from Us after distress that has touched him, he would most certainly say: This is of me, and I do not think the hour will come to pass, and if I am sent back to my Lord, I shall have with Him sure good; but We will most certainly inform those who disbelieved of what they did, and We will most certainly make them taste of hard chastisement.</AYA>
		<AYA id="041051">And when We show favor to man, he turns aside and withdraws himself; and when evil touches him, he makes lengthy supplications.</AYA>
		<AYA id="041052">Say: Tell me if it is from Allah; then you disbelieve in it, who is in greater error than he who is in a prolonged opposition?</AYA>
		<AYA id="041053">We will soon show them Our signs in the Universe and in their own souls, until it will become quite clear to them that it is the truth. Is it not sufficient as regards your Lord that He is a witness over all things?</AYA>
		<AYA id="041054">Now surely they are in doubt as to the meeting of their Lord; now surely He encompasses all things.</AYA>

	<SOURA id="42" name="The Counsel">
		<AYA id="042001">Ha Mim.</AYA>
		<AYA id="042002">Ain Sin Qaf.</AYA>
		<AYA id="042003">Thus does Allah, the Mighty, the Wise, reveal to you, and (thus He revealed) to those before you.</AYA>
		<AYA id="042004">His is what is in the heavens and what is in the earth, and He is the High, the Great.</AYA>
		<AYA id="042005">The heavens may almost rend asunder from above them and the angels sing the praise of their Lord and ask forgiveness for those on earth; now surely Allah is the Forgiving, the Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="042006">And (as for) those who take guardians besides Him, Allah watches over them, and you have not charge over them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="042007">And thus have We revealed to you an Arabic Quran, that you may warn the mother city and those around it, and that you may give warning of the day of gathering together wherein is no doubt; a party shall be in the garden and (another) party in the burning fire.</AYA>
		<AYA id="042008">And if Allah had pleased He would surely have made them a single community, but He makes whom He pleases enter into His mercy, and the unjust it is that shall have no guardian or helper.</AYA>
		<AYA id="042009">Or have they taken guardians besides Him? But Allah is the Guardian, and He gives life to the dead, and He has power over all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="042010">And in whatever thing you disagree, the judgment thereof is (in) Allah's (hand); that is Allah, my Lord, on Him do I rely and to Him do I turn time after time.</AYA>
		<AYA id="042011">The Originator of the heavens and the earth; He made mates for you from among yourselves, and mates of the cattle too, multiplying you thereby; nothing like a likeness of Him; and He is the Hearing, the Seeing.</AYA>
		<AYA id="042012">His are the treasures of the heavens and the earth; He makes ample and straitens the means of subsistence for whom He pleases; surely He is Cognizant of all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="042013">He has made plain to you of the religion what He enjoined upon Nuh and that which We have revealed to you and that which We enjoined upon Ibrahim and Musa and Isa that keep to obedience and be not divided therein; hard to the unbelievers is that which you call them to; Allah chooses for Himself whom He pleases, and guides to Himself him who turns (to Him), frequently.</AYA>
		<AYA id="042014">And they did not become divided until after knowledge had come to them out of envy among themselves; and had not a word gone forth from your Lord till an appointed term, certainly judgment would have been given between them; and those who were made to inherit the Book after them are most surely in disquieting doubt concerning it.</AYA>
		<AYA id="042015">To this then go on inviting, and go on steadfastly on the right way as you are commanded, and do not follow their low desires, and say: I believe in what Allah has revealed of the Book, and I am commanded to do justice between you: Allah is our Lord and your Lord; we shall have our deeds and you shall have your deeds; no plea need there be (now) between us and you: Allah will gather us together, and to Him is the return.</AYA>
		<AYA id="042016">And (as for) those who dispute about Allah after that obedience has been rendered to Him, their plea is null with their Lord, and upon them is wrath, and for them is severe punishment.</AYA>
		<AYA id="042017">Allah it is Who revealed the Book with truth, and the balance, and what shall make you know that haply the hour be nigh?</AYA>
		<AYA id="042018">Those who do not believe in it would hasten it on, and those who believe are in fear from it, and they know that it is the truth. Now most surely those who dispute obstinately concerning the hour are in a great error.</AYA>
		<AYA id="042019">Allah is Benignant to His servants; He gives sustenance to whom He pleases, and He is the Strong, the Mighty.</AYA>
		<AYA id="042020">Whoever desires the gain of the hereafter, We will give him more of that again; and whoever desires-- the gain of this world, We give him of it, and in the hereafter he has no portion.</AYA>
		<AYA id="042021">Or have they associates who have prescribed for them any religion that Allah does not sanction? And were it not for the word of judgment, decision would have certainly been given between them; and surely the unjust shall have a painful punish ^ment.</AYA>
		<AYA id="042022">You will see the unjust fearing on account of what they have earned, and it must befall them; and those who believe and do good shall be in the meadows of the gardens; they shall have what they please with their Lord: that is the great grace.</AYA>
		<AYA id="042023">That is of which Allah gives the good news to His servants, (to) those who believe and do good deeds. Say: I do not ask of you any reward for it but love for my near relatives; and whoever earns good, We give him more of good therein; surely Allah is Forgiving, Grateful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="042024">Or do they say: He has forged a lie against Allah? But if Allah pleased, He would seal your heart; and Allah will blot out the falsehood and confirm the truth with His words; surely He is Cognizant of what is in the breasts.</AYA>
		<AYA id="042025">And He it is Who accepts repentance from His servants and pardons the evil deeds and He knows what you do;</AYA>
		<AYA id="042026">And He answers those who believe and do good deeds, and gives them more out of His grace; and (as for) the unbelievers, they shall have a severe punishment.</AYA>
		<AYA id="042027">And if Allah should amplify the provision for His servants they would certainly revolt in the earth; but He sends it down according to a measure as He pleases; surely He is Aware of, Seeing, His servants.</AYA>
		<AYA id="042028">And He it is Who sends down the rain after they have despaired, and He unfolds His mercy; and He is the Guardian, the Praised One.</AYA>
		<AYA id="042029">And one of His signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth and what He has spread forth in both of them of living beings; and when He pleases He is all-powerful to gather them together.</AYA>
		<AYA id="042030">And whatever affliction befalls you, it is on account of what your hands have wrought, and (yet) He pardons most (of your faults).</AYA>
		<AYA id="042031">And you cannot escape in the earth, and you shall not have a guardian or a helper besides Allah.</AYA>
		<AYA id="042032">And among His signs are the ships in the sea like mountains.</AYA>
		<AYA id="042033">If He pleases, He causes the wind to become still so that they lie motionless on its back; most surely there are signs in this for every patient, grateful one,</AYA>
		<AYA id="042034">Or He may make them founder for what they have earned, and (even then) pardon most;</AYA>
		<AYA id="042035">And (that) those who dispute about Our communications may know; there is no place of refuge for them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="042036">So whatever thing you are given, that is only a provision of this world's life, and what is with Allah is better and more lasting for those who believe and rely on their Lord.</AYA>
		<AYA id="042037">And those who. shun the great sins and indecencies, and whenever they are angry they forgive.</AYA>
		<AYA id="042038">And those who respond to their Lord and keep up prayer, and their rule is to take counsel among themselves, and who spend out of what We have given them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="042039">And those who, when great wrong afflicts them, defend themselves.</AYA>
		<AYA id="042040">And the recompense of evil is punishment like it, but whoever forgives and amends, he shall have his reward from Allah; surely He does not love the unjust.</AYA>
		<AYA id="042041">And whoever defends himself after his being oppressed, these it is against whom there is no way (to blame).</AYA>
		<AYA id="042042">The way (to blame) is only against those who oppress men and revolt in the earth unjustly; these shall have a painful punishment.</AYA>
		<AYA id="042043">And whoever is patient and forgiving, these most surely are actions due to courage.</AYA>
		<AYA id="042044">And whomsoever Allah makes err, he has no guardian after Him; and you shall see the unjust, when they see the punishment, saying: Is there any way to return?</AYA>
		<AYA id="042045">And you shall see them brought before it humbling themselves because of the abasements, looking with a faint glance. And those who believe shall say: Surely the losers are they who have lost themselves and their followers on the resurrection day. Now surely the iniquitous shall remain in lasting chastisement.</AYA>
		<AYA id="042046">And they shall have no friends to help them besides Allah; and-- whomsoever Allah makes err, he shall have no way.</AYA>
		<AYA id="042047">Hearken to your Lord before there comes the day from Allah for which there shall be no averting; you shall have no refuge on that day, nor shall it be yours to make a denial.</AYA>
		<AYA id="042048">But if they turn aside, We have not sent you as a watcher over them; on you is only to deliver (the message); and surely when We make man taste mercy from Us, he rejoices thereat; and if an evil afflicts them on account of what their hands have already done, then-surely man is ungrateful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="042049">Allah's is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth; He creates what He pleases; He grants to whom He pleases daughters and grants to whom He pleases sons.</AYA>
		<AYA id="042050">Or He makes them of both sorts, male and female; and He makes whom He pleases barren; surely He is the Knowing, the Powerful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="042051">And it is not for any mortal that Allah should speak to them, they could not bear to hear and they did not see.</AYA>
		<AYA id="042052">And thus did We reveal to you an inspired book by Our command. You did not know what the Book was, nor (what) the faith (was), but We made it a light, guiding thereby whom We please of Our servants; and most surely you show the way to the right path:</AYA>
		<AYA id="042053">The path of Allah, Whose is whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth; now surely to Allah do all affairs eventually come.</AYA>

		<AYA id="043001">Ha Mim.</AYA>
		<AYA id="043002">I swear by the Book that makes things clear:</AYA>
		<AYA id="043003">Surely We have made it an Arabic Quran that you may understand.</AYA>
		<AYA id="043004">And surely it is in the original of the Book with Us, truly elevated, full of wisdom.</AYA>
		<AYA id="043005">What! shall We then turn away the reminder from you altogether because you are an extravagant people?</AYA>
		<AYA id="043006">And how many a prophet have We sent among the ancients.</AYA>
		<AYA id="043007">And there came not to them a prophet but they mocked at him.</AYA>
		<AYA id="043008">Then We destroyed those who were stronger than these in prowess, and the case of the ancients has gone before,</AYA>
		<AYA id="043009">And if you should ask them, Who created the heavens and the earth? they would most certainly say: The Mighty, the Knowing One, has created them</AYA>
		<AYA id="043010">He Who made the earth a resting-place for you, and made in it ways for you that you may go aright;</AYA>
		<AYA id="043011">And He Who sends down water from the cloud according to a measure, then We raise to life thereby a dead country, even thus shall you be brought forth;</AYA>
		<AYA id="043012">And He Who created pairs of all things, and made for you of the ships and the cattle what you ride on,</AYA>
		<AYA id="043013">That you may firmly sit on their backs, then remember the favor of your Lord when you are firmly seated thereon, and say: Glory be to Him Who made this subservient to us and we were not able to do it</AYA>
		<AYA id="043014">And surely to our Lord we must return.</AYA>
		<AYA id="043015">And they assign to Him a part of His servants; man, to be sure, is clearly ungrateful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="043016">What! has He taken daughters to Himself of what He Himself creates and chosen you to have sons?</AYA>
		<AYA id="043017">And when one of them is given news of that of which he sets up as a likeness for the Beneficent God, his face becomes black and he is full of rage.</AYA>
		<AYA id="043018">What! that which is made in ornaments and which in contention is unable to make plain speech!</AYA>
		<AYA id="043019">And they make the angels-- them who are the servants of the Beneficent God-- female (divinities). What! did they witness their creation? Their evidence shall be written down and they shall be questioned.</AYA>
		<AYA id="043020">And they say: If the Beneficent God had pleased, we should never have worshipped them. They have no knowledge of this; they only lie.</AYA>
		<AYA id="043021">Or have We given them a book before it so that they hold fast to it?</AYA>
		<AYA id="043022">Nay! they say: We found our fathers on a course, and surely we are guided by their footsteps.</AYA>
		<AYA id="043023">And thus, We did not send before you any warner in a town, but those who led easy lives in it said: Surely we found our fathers on a course, and surely we are followers of their footsteps.</AYA>
		<AYA id="043024">(The warner) said: What! even if I bring to you a better guide than that on which you found your fathers? They said: Surely we are unbelievers in that with which you are sent.</AYA>
		<AYA id="043025">So We inflicted retribution on them, then see how was the end of the rejecters</AYA>
		<AYA id="043026">And when Ibrahim said to his father and his people: Surely I am clear of what you worship,</AYA>
		<AYA id="043027">Save Him Who created me, for surely He will guide me.</AYA>
		<AYA id="043028">And he made it a word to continue in his posterity that they may return.</AYA>
		<AYA id="043029">Nay! I gave them and their fathers to enjoy until there came to them the truth and an Apostle making manifest (the truth).</AYA>
		<AYA id="043030">And when there came to them the truth they said: This is magic, and surely we are disbelievers in it.</AYA>
		<AYA id="043031">And they say: Why was not this Quran revealed to a man of importance in the two towns?</AYA>
		<AYA id="043032">Will they distribute the mercy of your Lord? We distribute among them their livelihood in the life of this world, and We j have exalted some of them above others in degrees, that some of them may take others</AYA>
		<AYA id="043033">And were it not that all people had been a single nation, We would certainly have assigned to those who disbelieve in the Beneficent God (to make) of silver the roofs of their houses and the stairs by which they ascend.</AYA>
		<AYA id="043034">And the doors of their houses and the couches on which they recline,</AYA>
		<AYA id="043035">And (other) embellishments of gold; and all this is naught but provision of this world's life, and the hereafter is with your Lord only for those who guard (against evil).</AYA>
		<AYA id="043036">And whoever turns himself away from the remembrance of the Beneficent God, We appoint for him a Shaitan, so he becomes his associate.</AYA>
		<AYA id="043037">And most surely they turn them away from the path, and they think that they are guided aright:</AYA>
		<AYA id="043038">Until when he comes to Us, he says: O would that between me and you there were the distance of the East and the West; so evil is the associate!</AYA>
		<AYA id="043039">And since you were unjust, it will not profit you this day that you are sharers in the chastisement.</AYA>
		<AYA id="043040">What! can you then make the deaf to hear or guide the blind and him who is in clear error?</AYA>
		<AYA id="043041">But if We should take you away, still We shall inflict retribution on them;</AYA>
		<AYA id="043042">Rather We will certainly show you that which We have promised them; for surely We are the possessors of full power over them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="043043">Therefore hold fast to that which has been revealed to you; surely you are on the right path.</AYA>
		<AYA id="043044">And most surely it is a reminder for you and your people, and you shall soon be questioned.</AYA>
		<AYA id="043045">And ask those of Our apostles whom We sent before you: Did We ever appoint gods to be worshipped besides the Beneficent God?</AYA>
		<AYA id="043046">And certainly We sent Musa with Our communications to Firon and his chiefs, so he said: Surely I am the apostle of the Lord of the worlds.</AYA>
		<AYA id="043047">But when he came to them with Our signs, lo! they laughed at them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="043048">And We did not show them a sign but it was greater than its like, and We overtook them with chastisement that they may turn.</AYA>
		<AYA id="043049">And they said: O magician! call on your Lord for our sake, as He has made the covenant with you; we shall surely be the followers of the right way.</AYA>
		<AYA id="043050">But when We removed from them the chastisement, lo! they broke the pledge.</AYA>
		<AYA id="043051">And Firon proclaimed amongst his people: O my people! is not the kingdom of Egypt mine? And these rivers flow beneath me; do you not then see?</AYA>
		<AYA id="043052">Nay! I am better than this fellow, who is contemptible, and who can hardly speak distinctly:</AYA>
		<AYA id="043053">But why have not bracelets of gold been put upon him, or why have there not come with him angels as companions?</AYA>
		<AYA id="043054">So he incited his people to levity and they obeyed him: surely they were a transgressing people.</AYA>
		<AYA id="043055">Then when they displeased Us, We inflicted a retribution on them, so We drowned them all together,</AYA>
		<AYA id="043056">And We made them a precedent and example to the later generations.</AYA>
		<AYA id="043057">And when a description of the son of Marium is given, lo! your people raise a clamor thereat.</AYA>
		<AYA id="043058">And they say: Are our gods better, or is he? They do not set it forth to you save by way of disputation; nay, they are a contentious people.</AYA>
		<AYA id="043059">He was naught but a servant on whom We bestowed favor, and We made him an example for the children of Israel.</AYA>
		<AYA id="043060">And if We please, We could make among you angels to be successors in the land.</AYA>
		<AYA id="043061">And most surely it is a knowledge of the hour, therefore have no doubt about it and follow me: this is the right path.</AYA>
		<AYA id="043062">And let not the Shaitan prevent you; surely he is your j open enemy.</AYA>
		<AYA id="043063">And when Isa came with clear arguments he said: I have come to you indeed with wisdom, and that I may make clear to you part of what you differ in; so be careful of (your duty to) Allah and obey me:</AYA>
		<AYA id="043064">Surely Allah is my Lord and your Lord, therefore serve Him; this is the right path:</AYA>
		<AYA id="043065">But parties from among them differed, so woe to those who were unjust because of the chastisement of a painful day.</AYA>
		<AYA id="043066">Do they wait for aught but the hour, that it should come ! upon them all of a sudden while they do not perceive?</AYA>
		<AYA id="043067">The friends shall on that day be enemies one to another, except those who guard (against evil).</AYA>
		<AYA id="043068">O My servants! there is no fear for you this day, nor shall you grieve.</AYA>
		<AYA id="043069">Those who believed in Our communications and were submissive:</AYA>
		<AYA id="043070">Enter the garden, you and your wives; you shall be made happy.</AYA>
		<AYA id="043071">There shall be sent round to them golden bowls and drinking-cups and therein shall be what their souls yearn after and (wherein) the eyes shall delight, and you shall abide therein.</AYA>
		<AYA id="043072">And this is the garden which you are given as an inheritance on account of what you did.</AYA>
		<AYA id="043073">For you therein are many fruits of which you shall eat.</AYA>
		<AYA id="043074">Surely the guilty shall abide in the chastisement of hell.</AYA>
		<AYA id="043075">It shall not be abated from them and they shall therein be despairing.</AYA>
		<AYA id="043076">And We are not unjust to them, but they themselves were unjust.</AYA>
		<AYA id="043077">And they shall call out: O Malik! let your Lord make an end of us. He shall say: Surely you shall tarry.</AYA>
		<AYA id="043078">Certainly We have brought you the truth, but most of you are averse to the truth.</AYA>
		<AYA id="043079">Or have they settled an affair? Then surely We are the settlers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="043080">Or do they think that We do not hear what they conceal and their secret discourses? Aye! and Our messengers with them write down.</AYA>
		<AYA id="043081">Say: If the Beneficent God has a son, I am the foremost of those who serve.</AYA>
		<AYA id="043082">Glory to the Lord of the heavens and the earth, the Lord of power, from what they describe.</AYA>
		<AYA id="043083">So leave them plunging into false discourses and sporting until they meet their day which they are threatened with.</AYA>
		<AYA id="043084">And He it is Who is God in the heavens and God in the earth; and He is the Wise, the Knowing.</AYA>
		<AYA id="043085">And blessed is He Whose is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and what is between them, and with Him is the knowledge of the hour, and to Him shall you be brought back.</AYA>
		<AYA id="043086">And those whom they call upon besides Him have no authority for intercession, but he who bears witness of the truth and they know (him).</AYA>
		<AYA id="043087">And if you should ask them who created them, they would certainly say: Allah. Whence are they then turned back?</AYA>
		<AYA id="043088">Consider his cry: O my Lord! surely they are a people who do not believe.</AYA>
		<AYA id="043089">So turn away from them and say, Peace, for they shall soon come to know.</AYA>

		<AYA id="044002">I swear by the Book that makes manifest (the truth).</AYA>
		<AYA id="044003">Surely We revealed it on a blessed night surely We are ever warning--</AYA>
		<AYA id="044004">Therein every wise affair is made distinct,</AYA>
		<AYA id="044005">A command from Us; surely We are the senders (of apostles),</AYA>

		<AYA id="044008">There is no god but He; He gives life and causes death, your Lord and the Lord of your fathers of yore.</AYA>
		<AYA id="044009">Nay, they are in doubt, they sport.</AYA>
		<AYA id="044010">Therefore keep waiting for the day when the heaven shall bring an evident smoke,</AYA>
		<AYA id="044011">That shall overtake men; this is a painful punishment.</AYA>
		<AYA id="044012">Our Lord! remove from us the punishment; surely we are believers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="044013">How shall they be reminded, and there came to them an Apostle making clear (the truth),</AYA>
		<AYA id="044014">Yet they turned their backs on him and said: One taught (by others), a madman.</AYA>
		<AYA id="044015">Surely We will remove the punishment a little, (but) you will surely return (to evil).</AYA>
		<AYA id="044016">On the day when We will seize (them) with the most violent seizing; surely We will inflict retribution.</AYA>
		<AYA id="044017">And certainly We tried before them the people of Firon, and there came to them a noble apostle,</AYA>
		<AYA id="044018">Saying: Deliver to me the servants of Allah, surely I am a faithful apostle to you,</AYA>
		<AYA id="044019">And that do not exalt yourselves against Allah, surely I will bring to you a clear authority:</AYA>

		<AYA id="044021">And if you do not believe in me, then leave me alone.</AYA>
		<AYA id="044022">Then he called upon his Lord: These are a guilty people.</AYA>
		<AYA id="044023">So go forth with My servants by night; surely you will be pursued:</AYA>
		<AYA id="044024">And leave the sea intervening; surely they are a host that shall be drowned</AYA>

		<AYA id="044027">And goodly things wherein they rejoiced;</AYA>
		<AYA id="044028">Thus (it was), and We gave them as a heritage to another people.</AYA>
		<AYA id="044029">So the heaven and the earth did not weep for them, nor were they respited</AYA>
		<AYA id="044030">And certainly We delivered the children of Israel from the abasing chastisement,</AYA>
		<AYA id="044031">From Firon; surely he was haughty, (and) one of the extravagant.</AYA>
		<AYA id="044032">And certainly We chose them, having knowledge, above the nations.</AYA>
		<AYA id="044033">And We gave them of the communications wherein was clear blessing.</AYA>
		<AYA id="044034">Most surely these do say:</AYA>

		<AYA id="044036">So bring our fathers (back), if you are truthful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="044037">Are they better or the people of Tubba and those before them? We destroyed them, for surely they were guilty.</AYA>

		<AYA id="044039">We did not create them both but with the truth, but most of them do not know.</AYA>

		<AYA id="045003">Most surely in the heavens and the earth there are signs for the believers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="045004">And in your (own) creation and in what He spreads abroad of animals there are signs for a people that are sure;</AYA>
		<AYA id="045005">And (in) the variation of the night and the day, and (in) what Allah sends down of sustenance from the cloud, then gives life thereby to the earth after its death, and (in) the changing of the winds, there are signs for a people who understand.</AYA>
		<AYA id="045006">These are the communications of Allah which We recite to you with truth; then in what announcement would they believe after Allah and His communications?</AYA>
		<AYA id="045007">Woe to every sinful liar,</AYA>
		<AYA id="045008">Who hears the communications of Allah recited to him, then persists proudly as though he had not heard them; so announce to him a painful punishment.</AYA>
		<AYA id="045009">And when he comes to know of any of Our communications, he takes it for a jest; these it is that shall have abasing chastisement.</AYA>
		<AYA id="045010">Before them is hell, and there shall not avail them aught of what they earned, nor those whom they took for guardians besides Allah, and they shall have a grievous punishment.</AYA>
		<AYA id="045011">This is guidance; and (as for) those who disbelieve in the communications of their Lord, they shall have a painful punishment on account of uncleanness.</AYA>
		<AYA id="045012">Allah is He Who made subservient to you the sea that the ships may run therein by His command, and that you may seek of His grace, and that you may give thanks.</AYA>
		<AYA id="045013">And He has made subservient to you whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth, all, from Himself; most surely there are signs in this for a people who reflect.</AYA>
		<AYA id="045014">Say to those who believe (that) they forgive those who do not fear the days of Allah that He may reward a people for what they earn.</AYA>
		<AYA id="045015">Whoever does good, it is for his own soul, and whoever does evil, it is against himself; then you shall be brought back to your-- Lord.</AYA>
		<AYA id="045016">And certainly We gave the Book and the wisdom and the prophecy to the children of Israel, and We gave them of the goodly things, and We made them excel the nations.</AYA>
		<AYA id="045017">And We gave them clear arguments in the affair, but they did not differ until after knowledge had come to them out of envy among themselves; surely your -Lord will judge between them on the day of resurrection concerning that wherein they differed.</AYA>
		<AYA id="045018">Then We have made you follow a course in the affair, therefore follow it, and do not follow the low desires of those who do not know.</AYA>
		<AYA id="045019">Surely they shall not avail you in the least against Allah; and surely the unjust are friends of each other, and Allah is the guardian of those who guard (against evil).</AYA>
		<AYA id="045020">These are clear proofs for men, and a guidance and a mercy for a people who are sure.</AYA>
		<AYA id="045021">Nay! do those who have wrought evil deeds think that We will make them like those who believe and do good-- that their life and their death shall be equal? Evil it is that they judge.</AYA>
		<AYA id="045022">And Allah created the heavens and the earth with truth and that every soul may be rewarded for what it has earned and they shall not be wronged.</AYA>
		<AYA id="045023">Have you then considered him who takes his low desire for his god, and Allah has made him err having knowledge and has set a seal upon his ear and his heart and put a covering upon his eye. Who can then guide him after Allah? Will you not then be mindful?</AYA>
		<AYA id="045024">And they say: There is nothing but our life in this world; we live and die and nothing destroys us but time, and they have no knowledge of that; they only conjecture.</AYA>
		<AYA id="045025">And when Our clear communications are recited to them, their argument is no other than that they say: Bring our fathers (back) if you are truthful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="045026">Say: Allah gives you life, then He makes you die, then will He gather you to the day of resurrection wherein is no doubt, but most people do not know.</AYA>
		<AYA id="045027">And Allah's is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth; and on the day when the hour shall come to pass, on that day shall they perish who say false things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="045028">And you shall see every nation kneeling down; every nation shall be called to its book: today you shall be rewarded for what you did.</AYA>
		<AYA id="045029">This is Our book that speaks against you with justice; surely We wrote what you did,</AYA>
		<AYA id="045030">Then as to those who believed and did good, their Lord will make them enter into His mercy; that is the manifest achievement.</AYA>
		<AYA id="045031">As to those who disbelieved: What! were not My communications recited to you? But you were proud and you were a guilty people.</AYA>
		<AYA id="045032">And when it was said, Surely the promise of Allah is true and as for the hour, there is no doubt about it, you said: We do not know what the hour is; we do not think (that it will come to pass) save a passing thought, and we are not at all sure.</AYA>
		<AYA id="045033">And the evil (consequences) of what they did shall become manifest to them and that which they mocked shall encompass them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="045034">And it shall be said: Today We forsake you as you neglected the meeting of this day of yours and your abode is the fire, and there are not for you any helpers:</AYA>
		<AYA id="045035">That is because you took the communications of Allah for a jest and the life of this world deceived you. So on that day they shall not be brought forth from it, nor shall they be granted goodwill.</AYA>
		<AYA id="045036">Therefore to Allah is due (all) praise, the Lord of the heavens and the Lord of the earth, the Lord of the worlds.</AYA>

		<AYA id="046004">Say: Have you considered what you call upon besides Allah? Show me what they have created of the earth, or have they a share in the heavens? Bring me a book before this or traces of knowledge, if you are truthful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="046005">And who is in greater error than he who calls besides Allah upon those that will not answer him till the day of resurrection and they are heedless of their call?</AYA>
		<AYA id="046006">And when men are gathered together they shall be their enemies, and shall be deniers of their worshipping (them).</AYA>
		<AYA id="046007">And when Our clear communications are recited to them, those who disbelieve say with regard to the truth when it comes to them: This is clear magic.</AYA>
		<AYA id="046008">Nay! they say: He has forged it. Say: If I have forged it, you do not control anything for me from Allah; He knows best what you utter concerning it; He is enough as a witness between me and you, and He is the Forgiving, the Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="046009">Say: I am not the first of the apostles, and I do not know what will be done with me or with you: I do not follow anything but that which is revealed to me, and I am nothing but a plain warner.</AYA>
		<AYA id="046010">Say: Have you considered if it is from Allah, and you disbelieve in it, and a witness from among the children of Israel has borne witness of one like it, so he believed, while you are big with pride; surely Allah does not guide the unjust people.</AYA>
		<AYA id="046011">And those who disbelieve say concerning those who believe: If it had been a good, they would not have gone ahead of us therein. And as they do not seek to be rightly directed thereby, they say: It is an old lie.</AYA>
		<AYA id="046012">And before it the Book of Musa was a guide and a mercy: and this is a Book verifying (it) in the Arabic language that it may warn those who are unjust and as good news for the doers of good.</AYA>
		<AYA id="046013">Surely those who say, Our Lord is Allah, then they continue on the right way, they shall have no fear nor shall they grieve.</AYA>
		<AYA id="046014">These are the dwellers of the garden, abiding therein: a reward for what they did.</AYA>
		<AYA id="046015">And We have enjoined on man doing of good to his parents; with trouble did his mother bear him and with trouble did she bring him forth; and the bearing of him and the weaning of him was thirty months; until when he attains his maturity and reaches forty years, he says: My Lord! grant me that I may give thanks for Thy favor which Thou hast bestowed on me and on my parents, and that I may do good which pleases Thee and do good to me in respect of my offspring; surely I turn to Thee, and surely I am of those who submit.</AYA>
		<AYA id="046016">These are they from whom We accept the best of what they have done and pass over their evil deeds, among the dwellers of the garden; the promise of truth which they were promised.</AYA>
		<AYA id="046017">And he who says to his parents: Fie on you! do you threaten me that I shall be brought forth when generations have already passed away before me? And they both call for Allah's aid: Woe to you! believe, surely the promise of Allah is true. But he says: This is nothing but stories of the ancients.</AYA>
		<AYA id="046018">These are they against whom the word has proved true among nations of the jinn and the men that have already passed away before them; surely they are losers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="046019">And for all are degrees according to what they did, and that He may pay them back fully their deeds and they shall not be wronged.</AYA>
		<AYA id="046020">And on the day when those who disbelieve shall be brought before the fire: You did away with your good things in your life of the world and you enjoyed them for a while, so today you shall be rewarded with the punishment of abasement because you were unjustly proud in the land and because you transgressed.</AYA>
		<AYA id="046021">And mention the brother of Ad; when he warned his people in the sandy plains,-- and indeed warners came before him and after him-- saying Serve none but Allah; surely I fear for you the punishment of a grievous day.</AYA>
		<AYA id="046022">They said: Have you come to us to turn us away from our gods; then bring us what you threaten us with, if you are of the truthful ones.</AYA>
		<AYA id="046023">He said: The knowledge is only with Allah, and I deliver to you the message with which I am sent, but I see you are a people who are ignorant.</AYA>
		<AYA id="046024">So when they saw it as a cloud appearing in the sky advancing towards their valleys, they said: This is a cloud which will give us rain. Nay! it is what you sought to hasten on, a blast of wind in which is a painful punishment,</AYA>
		<AYA id="046025">Destroying everything by the command of its Lord, so they became such that naught could be seen except their dwellings. Thus do We reward the guilty people.</AYA>
		<AYA id="046026">And certainly We had established them in what We have not established you in, and We had given-- them ears and eyes and hearts, but neither their ears, nor their eyes, nor their hearts availed them aught, since they denied the communications of Allah, and that which they mocked encompassed them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="046027">And certainly We destroyed the towns which are around you, and We repeat the communications that they might turn.</AYA>
		<AYA id="046028">Why did not then those help them whom they took for gods besides Allah to draw (them) nigh (to Him)? Nay! they were lost to them; and this was their lie and what they forged.</AYA>
		<AYA id="046029">And when We turned towards you a party of the jinn who listened to the Quran; so when they came to it, they said: Be silent; then when it was finished, they turned back to their people warning (them).</AYA>
		<AYA id="046030">They said: O our people! we have listened to a Book revealed after Musa verifying that which is before it, guiding to the truth and to a right path:</AYA>
		<AYA id="046031">O our people! accept the Divine caller and believe in Him, He will forgive you of your faults and protect you from a painful punishment.</AYA>
		<AYA id="046032">And whoever does not accept the-Divine caller, he shall not escape in the earth and he shall not have guardians besides Him, these are in manifest error.</AYA>
		<AYA id="046033">Have they not considered that Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth and was not tired by their creation, is able to give life to the dead? Aye! He has surely power over all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="046034">And on the day when those who disbelieve shall be brought before the fire: Is it not true? They shall say: Aye! by our Lord! He will say: Then taste the punishment, because you disbelieved.</AYA>
		<AYA id="046035">Therefore bear up patiently as did the apostles endowed with constancy bear up with patience and do not seek to hasten for them (their doom). On the day that they shall see what they are promised they shall be as if they had not tarried save an hour of the day. A sufficient exposition! Shall then any be destroyed save the transgressing people?</AYA>

		<AYA id="047001">(As for) those who disbelieve and turn away from Allah's way, He shall render their works ineffective.</AYA>
		<AYA id="047002">And (as for) those who believe and do good, and believe in what has been revealed to Muhammad, and it is the very truth from their Lord, He will remove their evil from them and improve their condition.</AYA>
		<AYA id="047003">That is because those who disbelieve follow falsehood, and have given them their dowries, taking (them) in marriage, not fornicating nor taking them for paramours in secret; and whoever denies faith, his work indeed is of no account, and in the hereafter he shall be one of the losers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="047004">So when you meet in battle those who disbelieve, then smite the necks until when you have overcome them, then make (them) prisoners, and afterwards either set them free as a favor or let them ransom (themselves) until the war terminates. That (shall be so); and if Allah had pleased He would certainly have exacted what is due from them, but that He may try some of you by means of others; and (as for) those who are slain in the way of Allah, He will by no means allow their deeds to perish.</AYA>
		<AYA id="047005">He will guide them and improve their condition.</AYA>
		<AYA id="047006">And cause them to enter the garden which He has made known to them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="047007">O you who believe ! if you help (the cause of) Allah, He will help you and make firm your feet.</AYA>
		<AYA id="047008">And (as for) those who disbelieve, for them is destruction and He has made their deeds ineffective.</AYA>
		<AYA id="047009">That is because they hated what Allah revealed, so He rendered their deeds null.</AYA>
		<AYA id="047010">Have they not then journeyed in the land and seen how was the end of those before them: Allah brought down destruction upon them, and the unbelievers shall have the like of it.</AYA>
		<AYA id="047011">That is because Allah is the Protector of those who believe, and because the unbelievers shall have no protector for them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="047012">Surely Allah will make those who believe and do good enter gardens beneath which rivers flow; and those who disbelieve enjoy themselves and eat as the beasts eat, and the fire is their abode.</AYA>
		<AYA id="047013">And how many a town which was far more powerful than the town of yours which has driven you out: We destroyed them so there was no helper for them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="047014">What! is he who has a clear argument from his Lord like him to whom the evil of his work is made fairseeming: and they follow their low desires.</AYA>
		<AYA id="047015">A parable of the garden which those guarding (against evil) are promised: Therein are rivers of water that does not alter, and rivers of milk the taste whereof does not change, and rivers of drink delicious to those who drink, and rivers of honey clarified and for them therein are all fruits and protection from their Lord. (Are these) like those who abide in the fire and who are made to drink boiling water so it rends their bowels asunder.</AYA>
		<AYA id="047016">And there are those of them who seek to listen to you, until when they go forth from you, they say to those who have been given the knowledge: What was it that he said just now? These are they upon whose hearts Allah has set a seal and they follow their low desires.</AYA>
		<AYA id="047017">And (as for) those who follow the right direction, He increases them in guidance and gives them their guarding (against evil).</AYA>
		<AYA id="047018">Do they then wait for aught but the hour that it should come to them all of a sudden? Now indeed the tokens of it have (already) come, but how shall they have their reminder when it comes on them?</AYA>
		<AYA id="047019">So know that there is no god but Allah, and, ask protection for your fault and for the believing men and the believing women; and Allah knows the place of your returning and the place of your abiding.</AYA>
		<AYA id="047020">And those who believe say: Why has not a chapter been revealed? But when a decisive chapter is revealed, and fighting is mentioned therein you see those in whose hearts is a disease look to you with the look of one fainting because of death. Woe to them then!</AYA>
		<AYA id="047021">Obedience and a gentle word (was proper); but when the affair becomes settled, then if they remain true to Allah it would certainly be better for them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="047022">But if you held command, you were sure to make mischief in the land and cut off the ties of kinship!</AYA>
		<AYA id="047023">Those it is whom Allah has cursed so He has made them deaf and blinded their eyes.</AYA>
		<AYA id="047024">Do they not then reflect on the Quran? Nay, on the hearts there are locks.</AYA>
		<AYA id="047025">Surely (as for) those who return on their backs after that guidance has become manifest to them, the Shaitan has made it a light matter to them; and He gives them respite.</AYA>
		<AYA id="047026">That is because they say to those who hate what Allah has revealed: We will obey you in some of the affairs; and Allah knows their secrets.</AYA>
		<AYA id="047027">But how will it be when the angels cause them to die smiting their backs.</AYA>
		<AYA id="047028">That is because they follow what is displeasing to Allah and are averse to His pleasure, therefore He has made null their deeds.</AYA>
		<AYA id="047029">Or do those in whose hearts is a disease think that Allah will not bring forth their spite?</AYA>
		<AYA id="047030">And if We please We would have made you know them so that you would certainly have recognized them by their marks and most certainly you can recognize them by the intent of (their) speech; and Allah knows your deeds.</AYA>
		<AYA id="047031">And most certainly We will try you until We have known those among you who exert themselves hard, and the patient, and made your case manifest.</AYA>
		<AYA id="047032">Surely those who disbelieve and turn away from Allah's way and oppose the Apostle after that guidance has become clear to them cannot harm Allah in any way, and He will make null their deeds.</AYA>
		<AYA id="047033">O you who believe! obey Allah and obey the Apostle, and do not make your deeds of no effect.</AYA>
		<AYA id="047034">Surely those who disbelieve and turn away from Allah's way, then they die while they are unbelievers, Allah will by no means forgive them.</AYA>
		<AYA id="047035">And be not slack so as to cry for peace and you have the upper hand, and Allah is with you, and He will not bring your deeds to naught.</AYA>
		<AYA id="047036">The life of this world is only idle sport and play, and if you believe and guard (against evil) He will give you your rewards, and will not ask of you your possessions.</AYA>
		<AYA id="047037">If He should ask you for it and urge you, you will be niggardly, and He will bring forth your malice.</AYA>
		<AYA id="047038">Behold! you are those who are called upon to spend in Allah's way, but among you are those who are niggardly, and whoever is niggardly is niggardly against his own soul; and Allah is Self-sufficient and you have need (of Him), and if you turn back He will bring in your place another people, then they will not be like you.</AYA>

		<AYA id="048003">And that Allah might help you with a mighty help.</AYA>
		<AYA id="048004">He it is Who sent down tranquillity into the hearts of the believers that they might have more of faith added to their faith-- and Allah's are the hosts of the heavens and the earth, and Allah is Knowing, Wise--</AYA>
		<AYA id="048005">That He may cause the believing men and the believing women to enter gardens beneath which rivers flow to abide therein and remove from them their evil; and that is a grand achievement with Allah</AYA>
		<AYA id="048006">And (that) He may punish the hypocritical men and the hypocritical women, and the polytheistic men and the polytheistic women, the entertainers of evil thoughts about Allah. On them is the evil turn, and Allah is wroth with them and has cursed them and prepared hell for them, and evil is the resort.</AYA>
		<AYA id="048007">And Allah's are the hosts of the heavens and the earth; and Allah is Mighty, Wise.</AYA>

		<AYA id="048010">Surely those who swear allegiance to you do but swear allegiance to Allah; the hand of Allah is above their hands. Therefore whoever breaks (his faith), he breaks it only to the injury of his own soul, and whoever fulfills what he has covenanted with Allah, He will grant him a mighty reward.</AYA>
		<AYA id="048011">Those of the dwellers of the desert who were left behind will say to you: Our property and our families kept us busy, so ask forgiveness for us. They say with their tongues what is not in their hearts. Say: Then who can control anything for you from Allah if He intends to do you harm or if He intends to do you good; nay, Allah is Aware of what you do:</AYA>
		<AYA id="048012">Nay! you rather thought that the Apostle and the believers would not return to their families ever, and that was made fairseeming to your hearts and you thought an evil thought and you were a people doomed to perish.</AYA>
		<AYA id="048013">And whoever does not believe in Allah and His Apostle, then surely We have prepared burning fire for the unbelievers.</AYA>
		<AYA id="048014">And Allah's is the kingdom. of the heavens and the earth; He forgives whom He pleases and punishes whom He pleases, and Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="048015">Those who are left behind will say when you set forth for the gaining of acquisitions: Allow us (that) we may follow you. They desire to change the world of Allah. Say: By no means shall you follow us; thus did Allah say before. But they will say: Nay! you are jealous of us. Nay! they do not understand but a little.</AYA>
		<AYA id="048016">Say to those of the dwellers of the desert who were left behind: You shall soon be invited (to fight) against a people possessing mighty prowess; you will fight against them until they submit; then if you obey, Allah will grant you a good reward; and if you turn back as you turned back before, He will punish you with a painful punishment.</AYA>
		<AYA id="048017">There is no harm in the blind, nor is there any harm in the lame, nor is there any harm in the sick (if they do not go forth); and whoever obeys Allah and His Apostle, He will cause him to enter gardens beneath which rivers flow, and whoever turns back, He will punish him with a painful punishment.</AYA>
		<AYA id="048018">Certainly Allah was well pleased with the believers when they swore allegiance to you under the tree, and He knew what was in their hearts, so He sent down tranquillity on them and rewarded them with a near victory,</AYA>
		<AYA id="048019">And many acquisitions which they will take; and Allah is Mighty, Wise.</AYA>
		<AYA id="048020">Allah promised you many acquisitions which you will take, then He hastened on this one for you and held back the hands of men from you, and that it may be a sign for the believers and that He may guide you on a right path.</AYA>
		<AYA id="048021">And others which you have not yet been able to achieve Allah has surely encompassed them, and Allah has power over all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="048022">And if those who disbelieve fight with you, they would certainly turn (their) backs, then they would not find any protector or a helper.</AYA>
		<AYA id="048023">Such has been the course of Allah that has indeed run before, and you shall not find a change in Allah's course.</AYA>
		<AYA id="048024">And He it is Who held back their hands from you and your hands from them in the valley of Mecca after He had given you victory over them; and Allah is Seeing what you do.</AYA>
		<AYA id="048025">It is they who disbelieved and turned you away from the Sacred Mosque and (turned off) the offering withheld from arriving at its destined place; and were it not for the believing men and the believing women, whom, not having known, you might have trodden down, and thus something hateful might have afflicted you on their account without knowledge-- so that Allah may cause to enter into His mercy whomsoever He pleases; had they been widely separated one from another, We would surely have punished those who disbelieved from among them with a painful punishment.</AYA>
		<AYA id="048026">When those who disbelieved harbored in their hearts (feelings of) disdain, the disdain of (the days of) ignorance, but Allah sent down His tranquillity on His Apostle and on the believers, and made them keep the word of guarding (against evil), and they were entitled to it and worthy of it; and Allah is Cognizant of all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="048027">Certainly Allah had shown to His Apostle the vision with truth: you shall most certainly enter the Sacred Mosque, if Allah pleases, in security, (some) having their heads shaved and (others) having their hair cut, you shall not fear, but He knows what you do not know, so He brought about a near victory before that.</AYA>
		<AYA id="048028">He it is Who sent His Apostle with the guidance and the true religion that He may make it prevail over all the religions; and Allah is enough for a witness.</AYA>
		<AYA id="048029">Muhammad is the Apostle of Allah, and those with him are firm of heart against the unbelievers, compassionate among themselves; you will see them bowing down, prostrating themselves, seeking grace from Allah and pleasure; their marks are in their faces because of the effect of prostration; that is their description in the Taurat and their description in the Injeel; like as seed-produce that puts forth its sprout, then strengthens it, so it becomes stout and stands firmly on its stem, delighting the sowers that He may enrage the unbelievers on account of them; Allah has promised those among them who believe and do good, forgiveness and a great reward.</AYA>

		<AYA id="057003">He is the First and the Last, the Evident and the Hidden: and He has full knowledge of all things.</AYA>
		<AYA id="057004">He it is Who created the heavens and the earth in six Days, then established Himself on the Throne. He knows what enters within the earth and what comes forth out of it, what comes down from heaven and what mounts up to it. And He is with you wheresoever ye may be. And Allah sees well all that ye do.</AYA>
		<AYA id="057005">To Him belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth: and all affairs go back to Allah.</AYA>
		<AYA id="057006">He merges Night into Day, and He merges Day into Night; and He has full knowledge of the secrets of (all) hearts.</AYA>
		<AYA id="057007">Believe in Allah and His messenger, and spend (in charity) out of the (substance) whereof He has made you heirs. For, those of you who believe and spend (in charity),- for them is a great Reward.</AYA>
		<AYA id="057008">How is it with you that you believe not in Allah?- and the Messenger invites you to believe in your Lord, and has indeed taken your Covenant, if ye are men of Faith.</AYA>
		<AYA id="057009">He is the One Who sends to His Servant Manifest Signs, that He may lead you from the depths of Darkness into the Light and verily Allah is to you Most Kind and Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="057010">How is it with you that you spend not in the cause of Allah?- For to Allah belongs the heritage of the heavens and the earth. Not equal among you are those who spent (freely) and fought, before the Victory, (with those who did so later). Those are higher in rank than those who spent (freely) and fought afterwards. But to all has Allah promised a goodly (reward). And Allah is well acquainted with all that ye do.</AYA>
		<AYA id="057011">Who is he that will Loan to Allah a beautiful loan? For (Allah) will increase it manifold to his credit, and he will have (besides) a generous reward.</AYA>

Gardens beneath which flow rivers! to dwell therein for aye! this is indeed the highest Triumph!"</AYA>
		<AYA id="057013">The Day will the Hypocrites- men and women - say to the Believers: "Wait for us! Let us borrow (a Light) from your Light!" It will be said: "Turn ye back to your rear! Then seek a light (where ye can)!" So a wall will be put up betwixt them, with a gate therein. Within it will be Mercy throughout, and without it, all alongside, will be (Wrath and) Punishment!</AYA>

And the Deceiver deceived you in respect of Allah.</AYA>

For many among them are rebellious transgressors.</AYA>
		<AYA id="057017">Know ye (all) that Allah giveth life to the earth after its death! Already have We shown the Signs plainly to you, that ye may understand.</AYA>

		<AYA id="057020">Know ye (all), that the life of this world is but play and pastime, adornment and mutual boasting and multiplying, (in rivalry) among yourselves, riches and children. Here is a similitude: how rain and the growth which it brings forth, delight (the hearts of) the tillers; soon it withers; thou wilt see it grow yellow; then it becomes dry and crumbles away. But in the Hereafter is a Chastisement severe (for the devotees of wrong). And Forgiveness from Allah and (His) Good Pleasure (for the devotees of Allah). And what is the life of this world, but goods and chattels of deception?</AYA>
		<AYA id="057021">Be ye foremost (in seeking) Forgiveness from your Lord, and a Garden (of Bliss), the width whereof is as the width of heaven and earth, prepared for those who believe in Allah and His messengers: that is the Grace of Allah, which He bestows on whom He pleases: and Allah is the Lord of Grace abounding.</AYA>
		<AYA id="057022">No misfortune can happen on earth or in your souls but is recorded in a Book before We bring it into existence: That is truly easy for Allah:</AYA>
		<AYA id="057023">In order that ye may not despair over matters that pass you by, nor exult over favors bestowed upon you. For Allah loveth not any vainglorious boaster,-</AYA>
		<AYA id="057024">Such persons as are covetous and commend covetousness to men. And if any turn back (from Allah's Way), verily Allah is free of all needs, Worthy of all Praise.</AYA>
		<AYA id="057025">We sent aforetime our messengers with Clear Signs and sent down with them the Book and the Balance (of Right and Wrong), that men may stand forth in justice; and We sent down Iron, in which is great might, as well as many benefits for mankind, that Allah may test who it is that will help, Unseen, Him and His messengers: For Allah is Full of Strength, Exalted in Might.</AYA>
		<AYA id="057026">And We sent Noah and Abraham, and established in their line Prophethood and Revelation: and some of them were on right guidance, but many of them became rebellious transgressors.</AYA>
		<AYA id="057027">Then, in their wake, We followed them up with (others of) Our messengers: We sent after them Jesus the son of Mary, and bestowed on him the Gospel; and We ordained in the hearts of those who followed him Compassion and Mercy. But the Monasticism which they invented for themselves, We did not prescribe for them: (We commanded) only the seeking for the Good Pleasure of Allah; but that they did not foster as they should have done. Yet We bestowed, on those among them who believed, their (due) reward, but many of them are rebellious transgressors.</AYA>
		<AYA id="057028">O ye that believe! Fear Allah, and believe in His Messenger, and He will bestow on you a double portion of His Mercy: He will provide for you a Light by which ye shall walk (straight in your path), and He will forgive you (your past): for Allah is Oft- Forgiving, Most Merciful.</AYA>
		<AYA id="057029">That the People of the Book may know that they have no power whatever over the Grace of Allah, that (His) Grace is (entirely) in His Hand, to bestow it on whomsoever He wills. For Allah is the Lord of Grace abounding.</AYA>

		<AYA id="058003">But those who pronounce the word Zihr to their wives, then wish to go back on the words they uttered,- (it is ordained that such a one) should free a slave before they touch each other: thus are ye admonished to perform: and Allah is well-acquainted with (all) that ye do.</AYA>

And when they come to thee, they salute thee, not as Allah salutes thee, (but in crooked ways): and they say to themselves, "Why does not Allah punish us for our words?" Enough for them is Hell: In it will they burn, and evil is that destination!</AYA>
		<AYA id="058009">O ye who believe! When ye hold secret counsel, do it not for iniquity and hostility, and disobedience to the Messenger; but do it for righteousness and self- restraint; and fear Allah, to Whom ye shall be brought back.</AYA>
		<AYA id="058010">Secret counsels are only (inspired) by Satan, in order that he may cause grief to the Believers; but he cannot harm them in the least, except as Allah permits; and on Allah let the Believers put their trust.</AYA>

If, then, ye do not so, and Allah forgives you, then (at least) establish regular prayer; give Zakat; and obey Allah and His Messenger. An Allah is well-acquainted with all that ye do.</AYA>

		<AYA id="059002">It is He Who got out the Unbelievers among the People of the Book from their homes at the first gathering (of the forces). Little did ye think that they would get out: and they thought that their fortresses would defend them from Allah! But the (Wrath of) Allah came to them from quarters from which they little expected (it), and cast terror into their hearts, so that they destroyed their dwellings by their own hands and the hands of the Believers. Take warning, then, O ye with eyes (to see)!</AYA>
		<AYA id="059003">And had it not been that Allah had decreed banishment for them, He would certainly have punished them in this world: And in the Hereafter they shall (certainly) have the Punishment of the Fire.</AYA>
		<AYA id="059004">That is because they resisted Allah and His Messenger: and if any one resists Allah, verily Allah is severe in Punishment.</AYA>
		<AYA id="059005">Whether ye cut down (O ye Muslims!) of the tender palm-trees, or ye left them standing on their roots, it was by leave of Allah, and in order that He might cover with shame the rebellious transgresses.</AYA>

		<AYA id="059007">What Allah has bestowed on His Messenger (and taken away) from the people of the townships,- belongs to Allah,- to His Messenger and to kindred and orphans, the needy and the wayfarer; in order that it may not (merely) make a circuit between the wealthy among you. So take what the Messenger gives you, and refrain from what he prohibits you. And fear Allah: for Allah is strict in Punishment.</AYA>
		<AYA id="059008">(Some part is due) to the indigent Muhjirs, those who were expelled from their homes and their property, while seeking Grace from Allah and (His) Good Pleasure, and aiding Allah and His Messenger: such are indeed the truthful:-</AYA>

And those saved from the covetousness of their own souls,- they are the ones that achieve prosperity.</AYA>

But pay the Unbelievers what they have spent (on their dower), and there will be no blame on you if ye marry them on payment of their dower to them. But hold not to the ties (marriage contract) of unbelieving women: ask for what ye have spent on their dowers, and let the (Unbelievers) ask for what they have spent (on the dowers of women who come over to you). Such is the command of Allah. He judges (with justice) between you. And Allah is Full of Knowledge and Wisdom.</AYA>

He knows that you are not able to do it, so He has turned to you (mercifully), therefore read what is easy of the Quran. He knows that there must be among you sick, and others who travel in the land seeking of the bounty of Allah, and others who fight in Allah's way, therefore read as much of it as is easy (to you), and keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate and offer to Allah a goodly gift, and whatever of good you send on beforehand for yourselves, you will find it with Allah; that is best and greatest in reward; and ask forgiveness of Allah; surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.</AYA>
